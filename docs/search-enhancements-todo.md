# Search Experience Enhancements TODO

This checklist captures the outstanding work for the updated search experience across campaign and general searches.

- [x] Add a global "email only" toggle that filters results after any search completes (campaign + general views).
- [x] Introduce shared view mode controls (table, list, gallery) for all search result presentations.
- [x] Ensure follower counts surface in every result table regardless of platform.
- [ ] Harden YouTube keyword search against duplicate creators at the data source and UI layers.
- [ ] Improve YouTube similar creator search links + bio/email enrichment reliability.

## In Progress
- [x] Implement shared filtering + view-mode state within the campaign keyword search results component.
- [x] Mirror the filtering + view-mode UX in the standalone search results component used outside campaigns.

## Completed
- [x] Campaign + general search UIs now support email-only filtering, multi-view toggles, and follower metrics in table mode.
