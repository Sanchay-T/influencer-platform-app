I have a new task for you: Integrating the Creator Enrichment API. This will add detailed creator insights to our platform (emails, engagement rates, growth data, brand partnerships, etc.).

🎯 YOUR MISSION:
Build a 100% working backend for creator enrichment. Come back to me when everything is tested and working - then I'll tell you how to integrate it in the UI.

📋 ASSIGNMENT DOCUMENT:
Read this first: docs/tasks/INTERN_ASSIGNMENT_ENRICHMENT.md

This document has everything you need:
- Clear step-by-step instructions
- Code skeletons with TODOs to fill in
- Testing guidelines
- What to deliver back to me

📚 QUICK START (First 30 mins):

1. Read the overview:
   open docs/tasks/README_ENRICHMENT.md

2. Run the demo script to understand the API:
   node scripts/test-enrichment-api-demo.js

3. Check the saved API response:
   open logs/enrichment-tests/*.json

4. Read the full assignment:
   open docs/tasks/INTERN_ASSIGNMENT_ENRICHMENT.md

🛠️ WHAT YOU'RE BUILDING:

Backend service that:
- Calls Influencers.Club API to get detailed creator data
- Caches results for 14 days (to save costs)
- Enforces plan limits (Free: 5/month, Paid: unlimited)
- Tracks usage in database
- Has proper error handling

Two API endpoints:
- POST /api/creators/enrich - Enrich a creator
- GET /api/creators/[id]/enriched-data - Get cached data

✅ WHAT TO DELIVER:

When you're done, give me:

1. Working code:
   - /lib/services/creator-enrichment.ts
   - /app/api/creators/enrich/route.ts
   - /app/api/creators/[id]/enriched-data/route.ts

2. Test results document:
   - /docs/ENRICHMENT_BACKEND_TEST_RESULTS.md
   - Show all your test results
   - Include curl commands that work
   - Show database was updated correctly

3. 
   - Show test script running
   - Show API calls in Postman
   - Show database updates
   - Test plan limits and errors

And the fact that there is a way in this code base dor yout o test usinga. test auth clerk user and all that so you can test all th4e backend apis in cli so you need to do it that is so damn ready that i jsut have to review and add it to the frontend and ui/ux get me?
