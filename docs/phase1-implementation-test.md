# Phase 1 Implementation Test Guide

## Testing the Email System + Onboarding Flow

### Prerequisites
1. ✅ Database migrations applied (`npm run db:generate`)
2. ✅ Environment variables configured:
   - `RESEND_API_KEY`
   - `EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS`
   - `QSTASH_TOKEN`
   - `QSTASH_CURRENT_SIGNING_KEY`
   - `QSTASH_NEXT_SIGNING_KEY`

### Test Flow

#### 1. User Registration & Onboarding
```bash
# Test the complete flow:
1. Visit /sign-up
2. Create a new account with Clerk
3. Should redirect to /onboarding/step-1
4. Fill in Full Name and Business Name
5. Should redirect to /onboarding/step-2
6. Fill in brand description (minimum 50 characters)
7. Should redirect to /onboarding/complete
```

#### 2. Database Verification
Check that user profile was created with onboarding data:
```sql
SELECT 
  userId, 
  fullName, 
  businessName, 
  onboardingStep, 
  brandDescription,
  signupTimestamp,
  emailScheduleStatus
FROM user_profiles 
WHERE userId = 'user_xxx';
```

#### 3. Email Scheduling Verification
Check server logs for email scheduling:
```
✅ [ONBOARDING-STEP1] Welcome email scheduled successfully
✅ [ONBOARDING-STEP1] Abandonment email scheduled successfully
```

#### 4. QStash Message Verification
Check QStash dashboard for scheduled messages:
- Welcome email (10min delay)
- Abandonment email (2hr delay)

### Expected Email Triggers

#### Signup Flow (Step 1 completion):
- **Welcome Email**: Scheduled for 10 minutes after signup
- **Abandonment Email**: Scheduled for 2 hours after signup

#### Trial Start (Future - when Stripe is added):
- **Trial Day 2 Email**: Scheduled for 2 days after trial start
- **Trial Day 5 Email**: Scheduled for 5 days after trial start

### Email Templates Testing

Test templates can be previewed at:
```
http://localhost:3000/api/email/preview/welcome
http://localhost:3000/api/email/preview/abandonment
http://localhost:3000/api/email/preview/trial-day2
http://localhost:3000/api/email/preview/trial-day5
```

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues:
1. **Missing UI Components**: Ensure `components/ui/alert.tsx` exists
2. **Database Errors**: Run `npm run db:push` to apply migrations
3. **Email Not Scheduling**: Check QStash configuration and API keys
4. **Clerk Auth Issues**: Verify middleware configuration

#### Debug Email Scheduling:
```typescript
// Check email schedule status in user profile
const user = await db.query.userProfiles.findFirst({
  where: eq(userProfiles.userId, 'user_xxx')
});
console.log(user.emailScheduleStatus);
```

### Success Criteria

✅ **Complete Implementation**:
- [ ] User can complete onboarding flow
- [ ] Database stores all onboarding data
- [ ] Welcome email scheduled (10min)
- [ ] Abandonment email scheduled (2hr)
- [ ] No errors in server logs
- [ ] QStash messages created successfully

### Next Steps (Phase 2)
Once Stripe business verification is complete:
1. Activate Stripe checkout in onboarding/complete
2. Add trial email triggers when payment method added
3. Test trial email sequence (day 2, day 5)
4. Implement subscription management
