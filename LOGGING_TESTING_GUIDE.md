# 🧪 Logging System Testing Guide

## Quick Testing (5 minutes)

### 1. **Basic Functionality Test**
```bash
# Test that the logging system works
npm run test:console-reduction
```

Expected output:
```
Testing console reduction...
[timestamp] New structured log
Test complete
```

Note: The debug log should NOT appear in production mode.

### 2. **Performance Test**
```bash
# Test performance overhead
npm run test:performance
```

Expected output:
```
1000 filtered logs took: [under 50ms] ms
```

### 3. **Sentry Integration Test**
```bash
# Test Sentry integration (check your Sentry dashboard)
npm run test:sentry-integration
```

Expected output:
```
Sentry test sent
```

## Comprehensive Testing (15 minutes)

### 4. **Full Test Suite**
```bash
# Run all logging system tests
npm run test:logging
```

This will run 8 phases of testing:
1. ✅ Core Infrastructure Tests
2. 🌍 Environment Behavior Tests  
3. 🛡️ Sentry Integration Tests
4. ⚡ Performance Impact Tests
5. 🔇 Console Output Reduction Tests
6. 🌐 API Integration Tests
7. 🛡️ Error Boundary Tests
8. ⚙️ Configuration Tests

## Manual Testing Checklist

### **Before Testing**
- [ ] Ensure you're on the `feature-admin-panel-wt2` branch
- [ ] Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed
- [ ] Check that `.env.development` is properly configured

### **Console Output Verification**

**Step 1: Check Development Console**
```bash
# Start development server
npm start

# In another terminal, make a test API call
curl http://localhost:3000/api/test-sentry
```

**What to look for:**
- ✅ Structured log entries with timestamps
- ✅ No emoji-heavy console flooding
- ✅ Appropriate log levels (INFO, DEBUG, ERROR)
- ❌ No `🚀🚀🚀` or `🚨🚨🚨` patterns

**Step 2: Check Production Mode**
```bash
# Set production mode
NODE_ENV=production npm start

# Make the same test call
curl http://localhost:3000/api/test-sentry
```

**What to look for:**
- ✅ Much fewer logs (debug logs filtered out)
- ✅ Only INFO, WARN, ERROR, CRITICAL levels
- ✅ Clean, readable output

### **Sentry Dashboard Verification**

1. **Go to your Sentry dashboard**
2. **Check for recent events** from your test calls
3. **Verify you see:**
   - ✅ Structured error messages
   - ✅ User context (if authenticated)
   - ✅ Request correlation IDs
   - ✅ Performance traces

### **Frontend Error Boundary Testing**

**Step 1: Test Error Boundary**
```bash
# Start development server
npm start

# Navigate to a page with error boundary
# Trigger an error to test the boundary
```

**What to look for:**
- ✅ Graceful error display (no white screen)
- ✅ Error sent to Sentry
- ✅ User-friendly error message

---

## Performance Verification

### **Memory Usage Test**
```bash
# Monitor memory during logging
node --expose-gc -e "
const { logger } = require('./lib/logging');
const start = process.memoryUsage().heapUsed;
for(let i=0; i<10000; i++) {
  logger.debug('Memory test', {iteration: i});
}
global.gc();
const end = process.memoryUsage().heapUsed;
console.log('Memory impact:', (end - start) / 1024 / 1024, 'MB');
"
```

**Expected:** Less than 5MB impact for 10,000 filtered logs.

### **Response Time Test**
```bash
# Test API response time impact
curl -w "%{time_total}s\n" -o /dev/null -s http://localhost:3000/api/test-sentry
```

**Expected:** Response time under 200ms (no significant logging overhead).

## Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

**❌ "Cannot find module './lib/logging'"**
```bash
# The core infrastructure may not be implemented yet
# Check if files exist:
ls -la lib/logging/
```

**❌ "Sentry not configured"**
```bash
# Check Sentry configuration
npm run sentry:test
```

**❌ "Performance overhead too high"**
```bash
# Check if you're in development mode with full logging
echo $NODE_ENV
```

**❌ "Tests failing"**
```bash
# Run tests with detailed output
npm run test:logging 2>&1 | tee test-output.log
```

### **Debug Commands**

```bash
# Check current environment
echo "NODE_ENV: $NODE_ENV"

# Verify Sentry configuration
cat instrumentation.ts

# Check if logging files exist
find lib/logging -name "*.ts" -type f

# Test TypeScript compilation
npx tsc --noEmit lib/logging/types.ts

# Check package.json scripts
npm run | grep test
```
