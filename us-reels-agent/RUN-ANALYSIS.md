# US Reels Agent - Run Analysis Report
**Date:** 2025-10-10
**Keyword:** "airpods pro"
**Status:** ⚠️ Rate Limit Exceeded (Non-functional Issue)

---

## Executive Summary

The agent executed successfully through **5 iterations** before hitting OpenAI's rate limit. The new **structured logging system** provides excellent visibility into the agent's behavior. However, several critical issues were identified that need resolution.

---

## Run Statistics

### Performance Metrics
- **Total Iterations:** 5 (stopped by rate limit, max is 10)
- **Total Duration:** ~2 minutes
- **Function Calls:** 8 total
  - Iteration 1: 1 call (serper_search)
  - Iteration 2: 1 call (sc_batch_posts)
  - Iteration 3: 1 call (sc_batch_transcripts)
  - Iteration 4: 2 calls parallel (serper_search + sc_batch_posts)
  - Iteration 5: 1 call (sc_batch_transcripts)

### Data Retrieved
- **Total URLs Found:** 82 unique reel URLs (46 + 36 from 2 searches)
- **Posts Retrieved:** 88/92 successful (95.7% success rate, 4 failed)
- **Transcripts Retrieved:** 0/92 successful (0% success rate - **CRITICAL ISSUE**)
- **Profiles Retrieved:** 0 (never called)

---

## Critical Issues Found

### 1. ❌ TRANSCRIPTS COMPLETELY FAILING
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Impact:** Without transcripts, relevance matching is entirely dependent on captions

**Evidence:**
```
Iteration 3:
  📥 [ScrapeCreators] Response: 0/46 successful (0.0%)
     ℹ️  46 empty/failed

Iteration 5:
  📥 [ScrapeCreators] Response: 0/46 successful (0.0%)
     ℹ️  46 empty/failed
```

**Possible Causes:**
- ScrapeCreators API v2 endpoint might be broken
- API key permissions issue
- Reels might not have audio/transcribable content
- API rate limiting on transcript endpoint

**Recommended Actions:**
1. Test transcript endpoint manually with a single URL
2. Check ScrapeCreators API status/documentation
3. Add retry logic with exponential backoff
4. Consider fallback: change `TRANSCRIPTS=always` to `TRANSCRIPTS=smart` or `TRANSCRIPTS=never`

---

### 2. ❌ NO PROFILES FETCHED
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Impact:** Cannot verify US location → Zero results

**Evidence:**
- Agent never called `sc_batch_profiles` with actual handles
- This means NO results passed relevance checks (likely due to missing transcripts)
- Without profiles, us_decision cannot be "US", so all results filtered out

**Root Cause Chain:**
1. Transcripts = 0/92 successful
2. Captions alone were insufficient for relevance matching
3. AI determined 0 posts were relevant to "airpods pro"
4. AI never fetched profiles (no relevant posts to check)
5. Final output = empty array

**Recommended Actions:**
1. Fix transcript issue first (root cause)
2. Improve caption-based relevance matching
3. Add logging to show which posts AI considered relevant vs not

---

### 3. ⚠️ RATE LIMIT EXCEEDED
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Impact:** Agent cannot complete full runs with OpenAI free tier

**Error:**
```
RateLimitError: 429 Request too large for gpt-4o in organization
Limit: 30000 TPM
Requested: 32972 TPM
```

**Root Cause:**
- Context window grew too large after 5 iterations
- Each iteration adds: function calls + function outputs + AI response
- 92 posts with empty transcripts still add significant JSON to context

**Recommended Solutions:**
1. **Short-term:** Reduce `MAX_RESULTS` from 60 to 30
2. **Short-term:** Reduce `SERPER_NUM` from 20 to 10
3. **Medium-term:** Implement context summarization after each iteration
4. **Medium-term:** Strip unnecessary fields from post data before sending to AI
5. **Long-term:** Upgrade to OpenAI paid tier or use Claude API (higher limits)

## What's Working Well ✅

### 1. Structured Logging System
The new logger provides **excellent visibility**:
```
┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┓
┃  🔄 ITERATION 4/10 - 2 function call(s)                                      ┃
┗━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┛
```

**Benefits:**
- Clear section separation for quick scanning
- Timing metrics for performance analysis
- Success rates for API calls
- Sample data for validation

### 2. API Integration
- **Serper:** 100% success rate (2/2 requests)
- **ScrapeCreators Posts:** 95.7% success rate (88/92)
- Parallelization working correctly (Iteration 4 ran 2 tools in parallel)

### 3. Agent Loop Logic
- Correctly using `function_call_output` (fixed from previous issue)
- Proper iteration counting
- Sensible search query expansion by AI

---

## Detailed Iteration Breakdown

### Iteration 1 - Initial Search
- **Tool:** `serper_search_reels_batch`
- **Queries:** 6 well-formed variations
  ```
  1. "site:instagram.com/reel airpods pro"
  2. "site:instagram.com/reel "airpods pro""
  3. "site:instagram.com/reel #airpodspro"
  4. "site:instagram.com/reel airpodspro"
  5. "site:instagram.com/reel airpods pro review"
  6. "site:instagram.com/reel airpods pro unboxing"
  ```
- **Result:** 46 URLs found
- **Time:** 3.8s

### Iteration 2 - Hydrate Posts
- **Tool:** `sc_batch_posts`
- **Input:** 46 URLs
- **Result:** 44/46 posts (2 failed)
- **Time:** 34s

### Iteration 3 - Get Transcripts
- **Tool:** `sc_batch_transcripts`
- **Input:** 46 URLs
- **Result:** 0/46 with text ❌
- **Time:** 48.7s

### Iteration 4 - Expand Search + Re-hydrate
- **Tools:** Parallel execution
  1. `serper_search_reels_batch` (4 new queries)
  2. `sc_batch_posts` (re-fetching same 46 URLs - possibly to verify)
- **Results:**
  - Search: 36 new URLs
  - Posts: 44/46 (same as before)
- **Time:** 33.2s

### Iteration 5 - Try Transcripts Again
- **Tool:** `sc_batch_transcripts`
- **Input:** 46 URLs (same as iteration 3)
- **Result:** 0/46 with text ❌ (same failure)
- **Time:** 56.1s
- **Then:** Rate limit error on next API call

## Recommendations

### Immediate (Fix Critical Bugs)
1. **Investigate transcript endpoint failure**
   - Test manually: `curl` a single transcript request
   - Check API key permissions
   - Review ScrapeCreators API docs/status

2. **Reduce rate limit pressure**
   - Set `MAX_RESULTS=30` (down from 60)
   - Set `SERPER_NUM=10` (down from 20)
   - Set `TRANSCRIPTS=never` temporarily to test other parts

### Short-term (Improve Reliability)
1. **Add retry logic** for failed API calls
2. **Context trimming:** Remove duplicate/unnecessary data from AI context
3. **Better error handling:** Don't retry transcripts if they failed once
4. **Add detailed relevance logging:** Show why AI accepts/rejects each post

### Medium-term (Optimize Performance)
1. **Implement context summarization** between iterations
2. **Strip large fields** (like full captions) before sending to AI
3. **Batch size tuning:** Find optimal number of URLs per iteration
4. **Add caching:** Don't re-fetch same URLs within a session

### Long-term (Scale for Production)
1. **Upgrade to paid OpenAI tier** or switch to Claude/Anthropic API
2. **Add monitoring/alerting** for API failures
3. **Build dashboard** for run analytics
4. **Implement resume capability** for interrupted runs

## Configuration Changes Made

### Fixed Issues
✅ Removed hardcoded "AirPods Pro" from package.json
✅ Added `strict: true` and `additionalProperties: false` to tool schemas
✅ Fixed `function_call_output` format in run.ts
✅ Implemented structured logging system

### Current .env Configuration
```bash
MODEL=gpt-4o
MAX_RESULTS=60          # ⚠️ Recommend reducing to 30
PARALLEL=16
RETRY=3
TIMEOUT_MS=30000
SERPER_NUM=20           # ⚠️ Recommend reducing to 10
TRANSCRIPTS=always      # ⚠️ Recommend changing to 'never' until fixed
PER_CREATOR_CAP=2
```

---

## Next Steps for Developer

1. **Fix transcripts** (highest priority)
   ```bash
   # Test a single transcript manually
   curl -H "x-api-key: $SC_API_KEY" \
     "https://api.scrapecreators.com/v2/instagram/media/transcript?url=https://www.instagram.com/reel/DPWEIyvifuh"
   ```

2. **Reduce rate limits** (quick win)
   ```bash
   # Edit .env
   MAX_RESULTS=30
   SERPER_NUM=10
   TRANSCRIPTS=never
   ```

3. **Test again**
   ```bash
   npm run dev -- "fitness"
   ```

4. **Monitor with new logging** - logs are now much easier to analyze!

---

## Conclusion

The agent's **core architecture is sound** and the **new logging system is excellent**. However, two critical blockers prevent successful operation:
1. Transcript endpoint returning 0/92 results
2. OpenAI rate limits being exceeded

Both are fixable. The transcripts issue is likely an API problem (not code), and rate limits can be addressed through configuration changes and context optimization.

**Estimated time to fix:** 2-4 hours
- 1-2 hours: Debug transcript endpoint
- 1 hour: Implement context trimming
- 1 hour: Test and validate
