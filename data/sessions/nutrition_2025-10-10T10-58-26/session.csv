Kennedy Jr.,"I‚Äôm leading a team at @hhsgov, along with @edsecmcmahon, targeting the woeful lack of nutrition education in medicine. We can reverse the chronic disease epidemic simply by changing our diets and lifestyles, but to do that, we need nutrition to be a basic part of every doctor‚Äôs training.","Hey everybody, I'm Robert F. Kennedy Jr., your HHS Secretary. Today, the Trump administration is demanding bold reform in our medical education system. I'm leading a team at HHS with the support of Secretary McMann at the Department of Education that targets a situation that everyone has long recognized as wrong, but no one has yet had the gumption to fix. It's the woeful lack of nutrition education in medicine. Poor diet drives America's chronic disease crisis, fueling seven of our ten deadliest conditions. Each year it claims an estimated one million American lives through diet-related illnesses. Meanwhile, we pour more than $4 trillion annually into treating these preventable diseases, and we continue to graduate physicians unprepared to confront their root cause. The good news is that diet not only causes these conditions, it can also prevent and reverse them. But for too long we've instead analyzed the chronic disease crisis, commissioned studies, and pontificated about the importance of nutrition without taking any meaningful action. Recent data reveals a critical disconnect. Although all medical schools claim to include nutrition in their curricula, most medical students report receiving no formal nutrition education throughout their entire training. This leads to a troubling reality. Most medical students recognize nutrition as necessary. Nearly all medical residents are asked to counsel patients about nutrition, but fewer than a quarter of practicing physicians feel adequately prepared to provide nutrition advice. We can reverse the chronic disease epidemic simply by changing our diets and lifestyles, but to do that, we need nutrition to be a basic part of every doctor's training. We'll start by embedding nutrition directly into college pre-med programs and testing it on the MCAT. Every future physician should master the language of prevention before they even touch a stethoscope. Under President Trump's leadership, we are going to systematically transform nutrition education throughout American medicine, from more than 200 of America's medical schools, 13,000 residency and fellowship programs, and ultimately each of the nation's 1.1 million practicing physicians. In the future, doctors won't just prescribe drugs, they'll be able to prescribe diets as well, confidently screening for diet-related diseases and collaborating with nutrition experts to recommend food-based solutions. Our reforms will save our country hundreds of billions of dollars and prevent millions of debilitating chronic diseases. This is an approach that is both radical and common sense. We're going to reconnect medicine with its roots. Hippocrates, the father of medicine, said, ""Let food be thy medicine, and medicine be thy food."" His advice remains true today, and we're bringing back food to its proper place in medicine.

https://www.instagram.com/reel/DEx3YSNv7H2,nutrition,drjessicaknurick,"Jessica Knurick, PhD, RDN","The U.S. food environment, healthcare system, and social determinants of health disproportionately harm low-income populations.

As a result, health outcomes like obesity, chronic disease, and life expectancy show staggering disparities. Men in the highest income groups live 15 years longer than those in the lowest, and for women, the gap is 10 years (PMID: 27063997). 

Improving the health of Americans means focusing on those struggling the most. It means policies that make nutritious food accessible‚Äînot $48 olive oil, but produce that millions of Americans in food deserts lack access to. Nearly 14% of U.S. households, including 1 in 5 children, face food insecurity, where they can‚Äôt consistently get the food they need to meet basic nutritional needs.

It means expanding healthcare access, funding nutrition programs, and addressing economic stability and other social determinants of health‚Äîevidence-based solutions that benefit everyone, not just the wealthy.

Any movement claiming to ‚Äúmake America healthy‚Äù while ignoring these systemic issues isn‚Äôt genuine. And when that movement is led by wellness influencers profiting from expensive supplements, detoxes, and cold plunge pools‚Äîrather than public health experts - it‚Äôs even less genuine.

Most things we were taught in the 70s and 80s were wrong. Nutrition is complex with every one having different metabolisms, hormones, etc. If you struggle with nutrition there is a lot of new information and its worth taking another look. Consider talking to a nutritionist or your physician ( make sure they are interested and up to date) 
If your gut is inflamed your joints will be inflamed. 
Your diet determines your weight, your exercise decides how you look at that weight
Eat mostly lean meats, fish, vegetables, and fruit. Decrease Sugar and processed carbs. 
You can‚Äôt outrun a bad diet
Genes play a role but bad habits do as well. Bad habits are often passed down through generations. Illness may run in your family because no one runs in your family. ( or eats well)

In our latest Giving Campaign video, we explore the vital role nutrition plays in student success and wellbeing. From boosting concentration, memory, and energy during long study hours, to protecting mental health and resilience ‚Äî proper nutrition is the foundation for thriving at university.

Yet, the reality is that many students face food insecurity, often skipping meals due to financial strain. This affects not only their academic performance but also their physical health and emotional wellbeing.

Watch as a qualified dietitian shares practical tips for healthier eating on a budget and reminds us that nutrition is not a luxury, but a basic need that fuels education, health, and hope.

https://www.instagram.com/reel/C7GEi82OmQn,nutrition,createbetterhealthutah,Create Better Health Utah (SNAP-Ed),"Make the move to reduce the added sugars in your diet!

Reducing intake of added sugars in our diets is the focus of the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans. A big reason for this focus is based on the finding that youth and adults in the United States consume twice the recommended daily amount of added sugars in their beverages alone.

Beverages such as sodas, some juices, energy drinks, sports drinks, and flavored water are a large source of added sugars. You'll also find added sugars in your flavored dairy products, baked goods, prepared sauces and dressings, and in some canned fruits.

It is recommended that we limit added sugars to 10% or less of our caloric intake per day, this is 50g based on a 2000-calorie per day diet. You can identify the amount of added sugar your food and beverages contain by referencing the nutrition facts label. As of 2021, these labels are required to identify added sugars in a product, separate from total sugars.

Here are a few tips to help you reduce the added sugar in your diet!
1. Move to more water - Cut one sugary drink out of your day and swap it for water! Need flavor? Add pureed fruit to make your water more tasty.
2. Read nutrition labels - Look at added sugars in the foods you eat and search for alternatives with less added sugars in them (i.e. no-sugar added barbecue sauce).
3. Replace sugar when baking - Use applesauce, banana, or sweet potatoes in place of sugar.
4. Make sauces and dressings from scratch - barbecue sauce, salad dressings, pasta/pizza sauce, and others can be made at home with less added sugar.

Increase your awareness of the foods and beverages you consume that contain added sugars and find one way to reduce the sugars in your diet this week.

The amount of sodium in the typical American diet definitely reaches these excessive levels. The average American eats about 3,400 milligrams (mg) of sodium a day‚Äîclose to 150 percent more than the daily limit recommended to avoid disease risk, 2,300 mg. Restaurant foods are a particularly concerning source of sodium for American consumers. Restaurant dishes contribute on average 31 percent of daily sodium consumption among adults and 26 percent among children.

We recently conducted a study that looked at the sodium content of menu items from the top 91 highest-grossing US restaurant chains, and found that many menu items at these large chains exceeded the daily recommended sodium value for US adults. This research also found excessive levels of salt hiding in unexpected menu items, like soups and salads that consumers might otherwise think are healthy, as well as sweet foods like desserts. Not ideal!

Understanding the relationship between diet and healthy ageing is important with ageing global populations. However, how dietary choices made during mid-life affect health in later years remains unclear. 

In a comprehensive analysis spanning three decades, Marta Guasch-Ferr√©, Anne-Julie Tessier, Frank B. Hu and colleagues identified specific dietary patterns that influence the likelihood of achieving healthy ageing, which includes maintaining cognitive, physical, and mental health beyond 70 years of age.

Eating a diet high in specific types of nutrients ‚Äî including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, unsaturated fats, nuts, legumes, and low-fat dairy products ‚Äî is associated with improved physical and mental health in older age. Meanwhile, greater intake of trans fats, sodium, sugary beverages, and red and/or processed meats was associated with poorer health in older age. 

The findings, based on an analysis of over 100,000 people in the US found that only 9.3% experienced healthy ageing and may help people improve their chances of living longer and healthier lives.
