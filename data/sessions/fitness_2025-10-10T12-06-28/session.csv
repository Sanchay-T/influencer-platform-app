https://www.instagram.com/reel/DPT_EYKjbXW,fitness,bewell_fitness,BeWell Fitness,"Today‚Äôs clip comes from the latest podcast roundtable of @peterattiamd. My first mentor, Michael Boyle, along with the other guests, speaks to the lack of participation in resistance training. 

‚Äú20% of people have gym memberships. 50% of those people, use it. Now we are down to 10%. What percentage of them are doing resistance training‚Ä¶ maybe half.  So now we are down to 5% of people.‚Äù
- @michael_boyle1959 

We can debate plenty in our world today. One thing you can‚Äôt is that the number 1 avenue for lifespan and quality of life is resistance training. Our goal is always to have people leave feeling better than when they walked in.","Do we have a sense of what percentage of people in the United States do not practice resistance training? Well, we know that 50% of Americans are not training or doing any kind of exercise. I, from the research that I've read up until recently, um, it's probably 70% do not meet the criteria for both activities. 70% in total then? Or do you think it's 70% of people who are doing some form of exercise? Total. That's a great question. I believe that it is 70% of people in total. Got it. Okay. Is that I I can't even fact-check that, it's, I mean, that's hard for me to imagine, but I can believe it. I can believe it. I think it's lower, in terms of if you're talking about resistance training, 'cause we were talking. You would say lower than 30% would do resistance training then? Yeah, because I think 20% of people belong to a gym. If we look at home gym stats aren't very good in terms of people, they're the home gym person who actually has one and uses it is is probably more unicornie than we think they are. And so if you start looking at that number, 20% have a membership. 50% of those people use it, which now brings us down to only 10% of people in the United States are actually in a gym, and then you look at that and say what percentage of them are resistance training? Maybe now we're down to 5% because you see a lot more hamster wheel people who are just walking on a treadmill or walking on a stair climber or whatever it is. So, I would think the numbers are are pretty low. We spoke a little bit about this, but we have digital statistics that actually show people who have signed up to train with our programs, let's say, either be at home or at the gym, the percentage of people that make it through our programs is only 20%, and that's very high in terms of the industry standard. That's twice the industry standard for digital. Right. Which is usually like 10% or so. So, those are people who showed the commitment, made a purchase, put their hard-earned dollars behind it, have everything they need, I would think, in terms of the tools and sets and reps and what's supposed to be done, and only 10% will finish a program. So, I think that's that's a pretty uh, remarkable statement on what why why people can't. I think there's a lot more of a desire to to do things, but the the ability to actually follow through is where I think we're having the hardest time. So it might be then, Gabriel, your stat is 70% of 50, the reciprocal of that, 30% of 50, 15, it might be that our range is somewhere from 5 to 15% if I were going to sort of triangulate between these three data points. Again, that's that's kind of a hard thing to digest if you're asking the question, um, and and I've never been, um, sort of shy about my thesis, which is of all the pillars that we have, um, to embark on improving our health, whether it be changing our nutrition, improving our sleep, taking the medications and supplements that can be actually quite important, I don't I just don't see any evidence that anything trumps exercise, um, just purely from an actual lifespan perspective, and from the standpoint of reducing the risk of chronic disease. When you then layer in the benefits it has on quality of life, I mean, it's just sort of a no-brainer.",119,https://instagram.famm9-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-15/559144584_1163647902343250_2189855894655254816_n.jpg?stp=c0.248.640.640a_dst-jpg_e15_tt6&_nc_ht=instagram.famm9-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=102&_nc_oc=Q6cZ2QHl8-hjwvzFsURqdeNO18xskwCGVeuZuwO2AbP2GP4vzlcgqXD6fLRbfWgr4dkXXH8&_nc_ohc=Okle0XlRt5MQ7kNvwFIAs5z&_nc_gid=7auKZLt7TfjJq9AFU-7r-w&edm=ANTKIIoBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfejD1cWLuPjPsupGERXdwa5lG1S6LEpai3vymXae13l3Q&oe=68EEAF3A&_nc_sid=d885a2,,,,2025-10-10T12:06:36.069Z,2025-10-10T12:07:34.947Z,transcript_fetched
https://www.instagram.com/reel/DPCLNaekTNf,fitness,strengthsciencetroy,Troy Taylor,"What % of the U.S. population engages in resistance training?

It‚Äôs probably less than you think, and decreases with age dramatically. 

I think/expect the % has increased since this 2020 report, but probably not by as much as I hope. 

It‚Äôs an excellent podcast, and while I don‚Äôt agree with everything shared it‚Äôs a huge overall net positive. 

@peterattiamd @michael_boyle1959 @drgabriellelyon @athleanx 

#fitness #strength #strengthtraining #strengthandconditioning #tonal #hypertrophy #fitover40 #exercise","a question that probably has an answer. Although I actually am a bit embarrassed to say I don't know the answer. So, I'm wondering if one of you guys do. Do we have a sense of what percentage of people in the United States do not practice resistance training? I was listening recently to the excellent Peter Attia podcast, round table discussion on resistance training and Peter opened with this question and the uh, panel audience uh gave some mixed answers in terms of what the data shows. So, I wanted to dive in and clean some of that up. This data is the most recent I'm aware of from the CDC from 2020 that shows that approximately 31% of the US adult population engages in the recommended two times a week of muscle strengthening or resistance training activity. And it also shows that about half of the population just under, uh, engages in the recommended aerobic activity, which is about 180 minutes of moderate, brisk walking activity. If you look at those that meet both the uh physical activity guidelines for strength training and also for aerobic training then that shrinks down to about 24% just under a quarter of your adult US population is meeting the overall guidelines. I actually think this data from the CDC is a little more interesting from a longevity focus. This is looking at the percentage of the US adult population that meets those physical activity guidelines for strength training and aerobic training, but it buckets it both by sex and by age. And so you can see in the big green graphs there that over 40% of men 18 to 34 meet those physical activity guidelines and just under 30% of women uh, 18 to 34 meet those guidelines. But what you see in both men and women is this very sharp decline in meeting the physical activity guidelines by age. So to the point where they're 65 and older only 15% of men or 10% of women are meeting those guidelines. Or set another way, 85 to 90% of people that age are not meeting those physical activity guidelines.",238,https://instagram.fbel17-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-15/553353236_782046518140562_277224038837766228_n.jpg?stp=c0.248.640.640a_dst-jpg_e15_tt6&_nc_ht=instagram.fbel17-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=102&_nc_oc=Q6cZ2QG7OtRluB-t_uo4tLHcPXHLxZFU9501Bf3HFMVIFZEsVSMEiA3CNYED9rG9POgswSI&_nc_ohc=3T25tSD-8zAQ7kNvwGF-A82&_nc_gid=JgHVlaSICV_bm4c86-7JPQ&edm=ANTKIIoBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfdgYS-WpjDSzPP1SoWKPbzLEtNO_aM_P3Hp7UbO_oOYTw&oe=68EEDF99&_nc_sid=d885a2,,,,2025-10-10T12:06:36.069Z,2025-10-10T12:07:34.947Z,transcript_fetched

1. Exercise Daily for at least an hour. You do not have to kill yourself from running, jogging, etc., but you should have some sort of moderate physical activity in your everyday life.

 2. Eat the Right Foods and Portion Each Meal
No matter how bad your stomach is telling you to go for candy over healthy food, try to stay away from sweets.

 3. Keep Track of Calories and Food Intake Per Day
Keeping track of how many calories you eat in a day will be helpful in planning out your physical exercising.

4. Be Sure to Get Sleep
Even though most of us have eight-hour jobs during the day or night, it is crucial to get enough sleep to recharge the body's batteries.

 5. Stay Motivated
An important key to being in shape is to set goals and keep a positive mindset. If you stay positive, you will be able to push yourself to get that fit body you've always wanted.",,503,https://scontent-ams2-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/491457336_1618287665529635_1526012860500568189_n.jpg?stp=c0.420.1080.1080a_dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08_tt6&_nc_ht=scontent-ams2-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=111&_nc_oc=Q6cZ2QEuwE1ARckT5NgXgJ4ZEJV08wweTwruU-L4Ij2RyJom1ABuaW6dSGPI9-lSgQRmpnU&_nc_ohc=6eQgDoeT1dkQ7kNvwEqiGcE&_nc_gid=eDf_h5T6mOkF1PbUU0KYmA&edm=ANTKIIoBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfepUAsjyGHXR4DxkMlJqOEu0blMwQbfaXkSjwucQdsHVw&oe=68EECFBA&_nc_sid=d885a2,United States of America,,,2025-10-10T12:06:36.069Z,2025-10-10T12:07:04.347Z,hydrated

Not videoed, trap bar deadlifts, sets of 5 working up to top set of 355x5. Not my best but pretty good at 42 years old and banged up.
Then did a circuit of multigrip bar presses, weighted chins and shrugs. Presses/chins decreased by 10lbs each set, every set pushed to mechanical failure. Shrugs stayed constant at 225 for 10 reps.
Finished with some 45 degree back raises with a 25lb plate. 
Instagram probably won't show this because I caught some warnings yesterday for sharing videos of things actually happening in the world that go against mainstream narratives. Which coincidentally just makes me want to get fitter...and stuff.",,38,https://instagram.fcgp38-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-15/558187302_823700126700238_8382685024614039713_n.jpg?stp=c0.80.640.640a_dst-jpg_e15_tt6&_nc_ht=instagram.fcgp38-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=110&_nc_oc=Q6cZ2QEoAIklbLlVgfBtzsGzTt4cjvS-1hTftAAszrdIIoHX47D2FBMPZuESM5hYy_1zjFo&_nc_ohc=bfcbfkZwb6IQ7kNvwEQaGtm&_nc_gid=q6pCNZra7gUkPFY703yhFw&edm=ANTKIIoBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_Afe0sx951sD0IFM2xbFHL7AbOiOCtpphajBD5oynjTFsIQ&oe=68EEC040&_nc_sid=d885a2,,,,2025-10-10T12:06:36.069Z,2025-10-10T12:07:04.347Z,hydrated

Which I do every once in a while but I kinda believed that‚Äôs all my body would be able to do when I was young and dumb and everyone over 30 seems sooooo old 

But I feel stronger now than I have in a while.
I found a gym I love finally. Nash is way behind in the health space but it‚Äôs getting better! 
8am, 4‚Äì6 days a week: conditioning, lifting, Pilates, walking, hiking‚Ä¶ whatever gets me moving. And an added bonus, I‚Äôm way more productive when I start my mornings this way.

I used to chase skinny, and soft. Because it wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúcool‚Äù for girls to have muscle back then but I love my strength now. Almost as much as I love carbs üôÉ
