Here are a few ‚Äúclassical Pilates‚Äù exercises designed by Joseph Pilates for the Reformer. 

During World War I, Pilates, who was living in England, was interned as a German ""enemy alien"". He used this time to develop his fitness program, which he later called ""Contrology,"" focusing on mind-body connection and core strength. 

While in the internment camp, Pilates began teaching his fitness methods to fellow internees, and later, he worked as an orderly in a hospital on the Isle of Man, where he developed his apparatus by attaching bed springs to hospital beds to help rehabilitate patients unable to walk. 

The springs he used to help patients move and strengthen their muscles while bedridden became the inspiration for the iconic Pilates Reformer. 

After the war, Pilates returned to Germany and continued to study fitness and movement, eventually collaborating with experts in dance and physical exercise. He later emigrated to the United States, where he and his wife Clara opened a studio in New York City, where he worked with dancers and athletes. 

Today, Pilates is more popular than ever because it helps with everything. It‚Äôs one of the best workouts for your mind and body. Make sure you work with a certified Pilates teacher who has experience. 

üî∏First Video: 
Footwork-‚Äúrunning or prancing‚Äù. I like to do a set with the pelvis neutral & another set with the pelvis lifted a few inches off the mat. The footwork exercises were meant to activate all the important muscles in our feet similar to acupressure. The feet are responsible for three quarters of our body & help with balance. 

üî∏Second Video:
‚ÄúThe Shoulder Bridge‚Äù which is a great way to work your glutes and back while stretching the front of your hips and shoulders. Adding the magic circle and light dumbbells makes it even tougher. 

üî∏Third Video:
‚ÄúFeet in Straps‚Äù-Leg Circles are a favorite for most Pilates lovers because it massages our hips and feels amazing. 

üî∏4th Video
‚ÄúThe Shoulder Bridge‚Äù w heels together toes apart.

It‚Äôs not a traditional Pilates exercise, but most of us consider this part of the work now‚Äîand for good reason. It‚Äôs a big strength move. To truly build strength, we must challenge and overload the body.

Notice how I‚Äôm moving my trunk through space. Instead  of flexing the spine, I‚Äôm treating this as a plank‚Äìside bend concept, adding the one arm push up takes this over the top.

https://www.instagram.com/reel/C_qoeQFyL3F,pilates workouts,thepilatescenter,The Pilates Center,"‚ÄúAbove all, learn how to breathe correctly‚Äù - Joseph Pilates 

This quote emphasizes the foundational, life-sustaining power of breath, much like the natural forces depicted in Quinn‚Äôs sculpture series. 

@amyalpers used this archival exercise, which we nicknamed archival monkey, and a photo of Lorenzo Quinn‚Äôs The Force of Nature sculpture as ideas in her Advanced Reformer Class. 

Just as the sculptures convey nature's raw, dynamic energy, Joseph Pilates highlights the vital force of breath as the key to sustaining life and strength and bodying the power that flows through all movement and existence. 

There is nothing more poetic than witnessing Amy connecting, layering in the art and science of contrology within her classes through her understanding of Pilates and the world around her.

Join Amy at our Archival Weekend, October 3-5th, or just in classes in-person and online during the week.

Michelle Leach and Alexa Idama have created two beautiful,  vibrant, welcoming Classical Pilates training studios in Atlanta. Both were active participants in many PSS workouts since its inception. 

What a joy it was to be able to connect ....IRL... touch, hug, honor, and appreciate each other and the work being accomplished, respectively, in the community.

Michelle and I have known and worked together since 2017. She moved to Atlanta  3 years ago, and this won't be the last time I visit her in this glorious space. 

I told Alexa there was no way I could travel to Atlanta and not pop in for a hug, kiss, and smile.... IRL, as we have only ""experienced"" each other via social media.

As you can see,  it was a TT weekend and so, meeting her in her new training center filled with a room full of apprentices, on the path to changing their lives and movement, was truly a special treat, for me as ""big sis.""

Having my brother and family with me to capture the moments with both of them was the icing on the cake. 

My heart is full. This was all I had hoped, planned and envisioned for the afternoon. üíõüíõüíõ

-
I‚Äôve completely fallen in love with the intentionality and flow of Pilates. It‚Äôs transformed not only my training but also my body: my strength in weightlifting has increased, my posture has improved (feet, ankles, glute balance, even scoliosis), and my diastasis has fully closed. My core has never looked better - I always joke that I have no business having an 8-pack after two kids just 19 months apart, but I credit it all to Pilates.
-
Pilates has also been a game changer for my pelvic floor strength and mind‚Äìmuscle connection, which has carried over into everything - from better glute development, to improved core definition, to more confidence and yes, even incredible sex.
-
I‚Äôll be sharing many of my favorite flows here, and they‚Äôll also be part of my next challenge (starting October 13!). I can‚Äôt wait to bring these workouts to you in a more structured way.
