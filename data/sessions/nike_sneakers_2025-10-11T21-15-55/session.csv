https://www.instagram.com/reel/DJDDRiIpUjG,nike sneakers,complexsneakers,Complex Sneakers,"Nike is crazy for this one. The latest release from their Dot Swoosh division is the Air Force 1 ""Dirty Triple White,"" a shoe that looks like it's been stomped out and worn for months. The sneaker looks filthy brand new out of the box. Nike says the shoe's dirty look is part of a scratch-away exterior that gets ""cleaner, crisper exterior the more time you put in."" So we tried to clean them up. The Air Force 1 ""Dirty Triple White"" releases on May 7 for $130 exclusively via SNKRS in the US.","1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,401
We know you're going to be mad
at this one. Nike's Dot Swoosh

2
00:00:02,401 --> 00:00:05,281
division is fully embracing the
Dirty White Air Force One meme.

3
00:00:05,281 --> 00:00:07,841
Dot Swoosh does drops related
to gaming and internet culture.

4
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:10,081
Hence them referencing all
those infamous images you see

5
00:00:10,081 --> 00:00:12,081
of cooked Air Force Ones
online. There's a little

6
00:00:12,081 --> 00:00:14,561
toothbrush attached to these.
They literally made a pair that

7
00:00:14,561 --> 00:00:16,881
comes fried out of the box. The
catches, you have to clean

8
00:00:16,881 --> 00:00:19,201
them. The idea is that if you
wear the shoe, the faux aging

9
00:00:19,201 --> 00:00:21,761
fades away into an actual clean
sneaker. We don't have the time

10
00:00:21,761 --> 00:00:23,921
for all that so we just grab
the magic eraser and got to

11
00:00:23,921 --> 00:00:26,081
scrub it in order to make the
shoes clean. For what it's

12
00:00:26,081 --> 00:00:28,161
worth, Nike tells us that you
really have to wear the shoe in

13
00:00:28,161 --> 00:00:30,541
order to get the dirty exterior
to fade off. Like you can

14
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:33,341
scratch it but apparently it's
easier to wear away manually.

15
00:00:33,341 --> 00:00:35,661
We even try to hit it with some
Windex to see if that did the

16
00:00:35,661 --> 00:00:38,301
trick any better. Despite us
working very hard on scrubbing

17
00:00:38,301 --> 00:00:40,461
the shoe. We gotta say we
couldn't get the Air Force One

18
00:00:40,461 --> 00:00:43,021
significantly cleaner. Maybe we
really gotta beat them up

19
00:00:43,021 --> 00:00:44,861
wearing the Coachella or
something to get the clean

20
00:00:44,861 --> 00:00:47,101
layer underneath. Not going to
lie after doing all this. It

21
00:00:47,101 --> 00:00:49,661
kind of feels like we got
tricked. Like Nike trolled us

22
00:00:49,661 --> 00:00:52,061
into cleaning their sneakers
and to be honest that totally

23
00:00:52,061 --> 00:00:54,861
makes sense for a meme sneaker
like this smoked out Air Force

24
00:00:54,861 --> 00:00:57,021
One. Like this is the final
product and you can barely tell

25
00:00:57,021 --> 00:00:59,321
the difference between the shoe
we clean and the shoe we The

26
00:00:59,321 --> 00:01:02,041
Dirty Triple White Girl, sorry,
Dirty Triple White releases

27

Here’s a quick traction test of the Nike A’One “Pink A’ura”. Performance has been very consistent for me, while dust pick up is manageable with occasional wiping needed. Retailing at $110 USD, this will surely continue to be a very popular hoop shoe with the simple and appealing aesthetics.

Let me know your thoughts on the Nike A’One in the comments!

the shoes in my collection but
it's day two of dunkweek where

5
00:00:13,761 --> 00:00:17,121
yesterday I said that I was
going to wear all my dunks this

6
00:00:17,121 --> 00:00:21,841
week well at least five pair
from Monday to Friday so day

7
00:00:21,841 --> 00:00:27,761
two of dunkweek it's about
these Nike dunks these are your

8
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:37,461
low top USC colorway damn dude
Yukon women and Paige is a

9
00:00:37,461 --> 00:00:41,061
beast. Anyway, Juju, you are
too. You probably have several

10
00:00:41,061 --> 00:00:45,701
pairs of these. These are your
USC, the red, the yellow, the

11
00:00:45,701 --> 00:00:51,381
white. These shoes I had to get
when I was overseas because

12
00:00:51,381 --> 00:00:55,381
they did not have this colorway
in the States just yet. I

13
00:00:55,381 --> 00:01:00,501
copped them which I love for
retail price but it was

14
00:01:00,501 --> 00:01:04,181
actually Euro but it was like
retail Euro price and then I

15
00:01:04,181 --> 00:01:08,581
actually got like my 20% off
because I do the listen if you

16
00:01:08,581 --> 00:01:11,961
ever try abroad. Do the whole
that tax. Fill out the

17
00:01:11,961 --> 00:01:14,281
paperwork because I'll give you
money back. So, I actually got

18
00:01:14,281 --> 00:01:16,921
this cheaper than retail
because I filled out my tax

19
00:01:16,921 --> 00:01:21,881
forms and boom, there you go.
So, for day 93 of my challenge

20
00:01:21,881 --> 00:01:28,041
and day two of dunkweek, it's
these bad boys. Different day,

21
00:01:28,041 --> 00:01:31,001
different kicks.

00:00:24,121 --> 00:00:27,081
quick and special review in
comparison for you guys. So

3
00:00:27,081 --> 00:00:30,921
right in front of me I have the
pair of offwhite MCA Sample.

4
00:00:30,921 --> 00:00:34,521
This pair was rumored to be
around three to five pairs. And

5
00:00:34,521 --> 00:00:38,121
then it was first debuted at
the Louis Vuitton Fall and

6
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:42,441
Winter 2020 collection runway.
And it was in Verger's Clouds

7
00:00:42,441 --> 00:00:45,561
Collection. You saw him wearing
the shoes. However the pair he

8
00:00:45,561 --> 00:00:48,121
was wearing slightly different.
Uh didn't have a white

9
00:00:48,121 --> 00:00:52,601
lettering on the midsole. And
then This one was a size 12 as

10
00:00:52,601 --> 00:00:56,361
well so which was I think was
its personal size and the MC

11
00:00:56,361 --> 00:00:59,881
sneaker was actually a homage
to the modern using of Modern

12
00:00:59,881 --> 00:01:02,921
Art Chicago. This was the
release version which is all

13
00:01:02,921 --> 00:01:05,961
blue and the simple version is
slightly different. It has a

14
00:01:05,961 --> 00:01:08,841
two sets of lacing system which
was seen on the offwhite dunks

15
00:01:08,841 --> 00:01:11,641
as well and I'm I'm glad to own
this pair because this is one

16
00:01:11,641 --> 00:01:14,601
of the most thought after
offwhite zippo compared to the

#nike #nikeshoes #newyorkcity #newyork #indianinusa","This is the Nike Innovation Center in New York City.
Nike का यह फ्लैगशिप स्टोर बहुत ही ज्यादा वाइब्रेंट है। जैसे ही आप स्टोर में एंटर करते हो, यहां पर आपको एनर्जी और क्रिएटिविटी फील हो जाती है। यह एक रेगुलर Nike स्टोर नहीं है। यह पूरा फ्यूचरिस्टिक इनोवेशन का हब है। सिक्स फ्लोर के इस Nike इनोवेशन सेंटर में जो सबसे ज्यादा मुझे अच्छा लगा वो था कस्टमाइजेशन ऑप्शन, जहां पर आप अपने शूज को डिजाइन कर सकते हो कलर, मटेरियल, सब कुछ अपने अकॉर्डिंग। Nike का परफॉर्मेंस गियर भी देखा जो एथलीट्स के लिए डिज़ाइन किया है। If you are in New York and a Nike fan, then this place is must visit.

I've honestly had these shoes for a very long time, and crazy enough these actually come from one of the most popular heavy metal bands of all time. Rumored only 24 pairs worldwide, 200 million units sold across the world, and being one of the most popular heavy metal bands of all time, we have the Iron Maiden SB Dunk High and oh my god. Even these, being over two decades old, they are still brand new to this day, and that is absolutely insane. And as I mentioned earlier, only 24 pairs in the entire world exist only given to the friends and family members of the Iron Maiden band. With that many pairs existing in the entire world, who knows how many left are still brand new. These are probably one of, if not, the rarest Nike SB Dunk to exist. Now to start off with the details on this shoe, you have a very premium shiny black leather with a very gorgeous, beautiful dark suede to follow along. And then on the back of the right heel, you have ""Maiden"" and on the back of the left heel, you have ""Iron,"" obviously referring to Iron Maiden. A cool detail that we never see Nike do is a clear swoosh. Now, obviously you could see it, for being a 22 year old shoe it has yellowed, but actually on this side, it is still kind of somewhat clear. Of course, the sickest detail of them all, you have Eddie right here on the side panel with some nice background. And, for those that don't know who Eddie is, he's basically Iron Maiden's mascot. He was all over their albums and certain singles and a bunch of famous vintage tees that now also go for thousands of dollars. And of course, you have it on the left shoe as well, slightly different background, but still same character. And right here on the right insole, you have Eddie, of course. But the left insole is actually pretty cool and has some deep significance to the fans. Now the ""scream for me Long Beach"" dates all the way back to 1985 during the World Slavery Tour that they had in Long Beach, California. The band was screaming into the mic, ""Scream for me Long Beach."" And obviously that was their way of saying ""We love you Long Beach."" And the crowd went absolutely crazy and that moment was so significant that during the year of that whole tour they dropped an album and this slogan made it on there many times. And other than coming with the box and some red laces, there's nothing else that goes with this shoe and crazy enough they are currently fetching anywhere between $25 to $35,000 depending on the size or if you can even find one. But do you think it's worth it? <noise>",2805,https://instagram.fuio16-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-15/552970933_1016293943874217_5566153719947198325_n.jpg?stp=c0.248.640.640a_dst-jpg_e15_tt6&_nc_ht=instagram.fuio16-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=101&_nc_oc=Q6cZ2QGU1ol2IhKdUygRHFrhnGfqifHTkLrtcLgMdGPJijnT-Nj_tX2A5BlNY2GLHgZpUJ8&_nc_ohc=NFTdReiqPsYQ7kNvwFr1s5c&_nc_gid=Z6LUD8lcNijd2qMnbV6NJA&edm=ANTKIIoBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfeORKMoUheC-7BuacQRFJl13vEDOPFz8dk3d_2XyOL2Bg&oe=68F0A3C6&_nc_sid=d885a2,,,,2025-10-11T21:16:02.683Z,2025-10-11T21:17:17.187Z,transcript_fetched

#nikeshoes #nikehistory #onthisday","These marketing geniuses, as they eventually became, were kind of flogging some imports out the back of that car, track meet as a side hustle, and didn't have a great grip on branding. You know, had one of the world's most recognizable symbols in their hands, weren't sure about it. You know, later had ""Just Do It"", obviously, which remains advertising executives' favorite ever slogan when they're voting for what's the best campaign of all time. Air Jordan's still to come and that association with sports stars. But at this point, even though they had the waffle shoe, the patent number 3,793,750, they didn't call it the Waffle Shoe for like another three years. They went to the 1972 United States Olympic Trials in Eugene the following year and called it the Moon Shoe. And the reason for that was it kind of made an impression in the sand and the dirt which looked a bit like Neil Armstrong's footprint. But again, like they had waffle shoe right there, but it still took a while for people to be like, ""That's the Waffle Shoe that we're selling."" Not the Moon Shoe.",380,https://instagram.fntr5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-15/480989907_2018958031914264_6625330264911842202_n.jpg?stp=c0.248.640.640a_dst-jpg_e15_tt6&_nc_ht=instagram.fntr5-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=100&_nc_oc=Q6cZ2QFMksP_F_SIOk_VgaJ6K3eSGifHWdTk0Jqinrqn4M5wIEuDUYDnKlEfyEvXgzUDad8&_nc_ohc=Xv1u_rSXcLgQ7kNvwHyxtNr&_nc_gid=9b0MZ_6bVNlOYexDiTcWNg&edm=ANTKIIoBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AffoX8EN36hBo65KV8f2yzNuZXoYXw6HXOI1pdrX7AYDsQ&oe=68F0B156&_nc_sid=d885a2,,,,2025-10-11T21:16:02.683Z,2025-10-11T21:17:17.187Z,transcript_fetched
