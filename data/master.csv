Here are a few ‚Äúclassical Pilates‚Äù exercises designed by Joseph Pilates for the Reformer. 

During World War I, Pilates, who was living in England, was interned as a German ""enemy alien"". He used this time to develop his fitness program, which he later called ""Contrology,"" focusing on mind-body connection and core strength. 

While in the internment camp, Pilates began teaching his fitness methods to fellow internees, and later, he worked as an orderly in a hospital on the Isle of Man, where he developed his apparatus by attaching bed springs to hospital beds to help rehabilitate patients unable to walk. 

The springs he used to help patients move and strengthen their muscles while bedridden became the inspiration for the iconic Pilates Reformer. 

After the war, Pilates returned to Germany and continued to study fitness and movement, eventually collaborating with experts in dance and physical exercise. He later emigrated to the United States, where he and his wife Clara opened a studio in New York City, where he worked with dancers and athletes. 

Today, Pilates is more popular than ever because it helps with everything. It‚Äôs one of the best workouts for your mind and body. Make sure you work with a certified Pilates teacher who has experience. 

üî∏First Video: 
Footwork-‚Äúrunning or prancing‚Äù. I like to do a set with the pelvis neutral & another set with the pelvis lifted a few inches off the mat. The footwork exercises were meant to activate all the important muscles in our feet similar to acupressure. The feet are responsible for three quarters of our body & help with balance. 

üî∏Second Video:
‚ÄúThe Shoulder Bridge‚Äù which is a great way to work your glutes and back while stretching the front of your hips and shoulders. Adding the magic circle and light dumbbells makes it even tougher. 

üî∏Third Video:
‚ÄúFeet in Straps‚Äù-Leg Circles are a favorite for most Pilates lovers because it massages our hips and feels amazing. 

üî∏4th Video
‚ÄúThe Shoulder Bridge‚Äù w heels together toes apart.

üí• Following safety protocol and instructor 
  cues

üí• Listening to your body 

üí• Knowing how to modify for your 
  restrictions/knowing your limits during that 
  class

üí• Having proper form and being open to
  corrections, do not muscle through

üí• Asking for a progression when appropriate

In this class there are 3 levels of difficulty for the same exercise. Side plank on the ground for those that may have shoulder issues and need a modification (or just not comfortable doing a side plank on the reformers just yet, but can do everytjing else during a level 2 class), side plank on the reformer with no movement, and side plank with movement for progression.

It‚Äôs not a traditional Pilates exercise, but most of us consider this part of the work now‚Äîand for good reason. It‚Äôs a big strength move. To truly build strength, we must challenge and overload the body.

Notice how I‚Äôm moving my trunk through space. Instead  of flexing the spine, I‚Äôm treating this as a plank‚Äìside bend concept, adding the one arm push up takes this over the top.

Join me as I break this down in my Pro Class this week:

This quote emphasizes the foundational, life-sustaining power of breath, much like the natural forces depicted in Quinn‚Äôs sculpture series. 

@amyalpers used this archival exercise, which we nicknamed archival monkey, and a photo of Lorenzo Quinn‚Äôs The Force of Nature sculpture as ideas in her Advanced Reformer Class. 

Just as the sculptures convey nature's raw, dynamic energy, Joseph Pilates highlights the vital force of breath as the key to sustaining life and strength and bodying the power that flows through all movement and existence. 

There is nothing more poetic than witnessing Amy connecting, layering in the art and science of contrology within her classes through her understanding of Pilates and the world around her.

Join Amy at our Archival Weekend, October 3-5th, or just in classes in-person and online during the week.

Michelle Leach and Alexa Idama have created two beautiful,  vibrant, welcoming Classical Pilates training studios in Atlanta. Both were active participants in many PSS workouts since its inception. 

What a joy it was to be able to connect ....IRL... touch, hug, honor, and appreciate each other and the work being accomplished, respectively, in the community.

Michelle and I have known and worked together since 2017. She moved to Atlanta  3 years ago, and this won't be the last time I visit her in this glorious space. 

I told Alexa there was no way I could travel to Atlanta and not pop in for a hug, kiss, and smile.... IRL, as we have only ""experienced"" each other via social media.

As you can see,  it was a TT weekend and so, meeting her in her new training center filled with a room full of apprentices, on the path to changing their lives and movement, was truly a special treat, for me as ""big sis.""

Having my brother and family with me to capture the moments with both of them was the icing on the cake. 

My heart is full. This was all I had hoped, planned and envisioned for the afternoon. üíõüíõüíõ

-
I‚Äôve completely fallen in love with the intentionality and flow of Pilates. It‚Äôs transformed not only my training but also my body: my strength in weightlifting has increased, my posture has improved (feet, ankles, glute balance, even scoliosis), and my diastasis has fully closed. My core has never looked better - I always joke that I have no business having an 8-pack after two kids just 19 months apart, but I credit it all to Pilates.
-
Pilates has also been a game changer for my pelvic floor strength and mind‚Äìmuscle connection, which has carried over into everything - from better glute development, to improved core definition, to more confidence and yes, even incredible sex.
-
I‚Äôll be sharing many of my favorite flows here, and they‚Äôll also be part of my next challenge (starting October 13!). I can‚Äôt wait to bring these workouts to you in a more structured way.

https://www.instagram.com/reel/DOZVGJ4iISR,airpods,daily_ai_smart_tools,Latest AI Tools | AI News | Technology Trends,"AirPods Pro 3 introduces a set of breakthrough features, including real-time live translation, new fitness sensors, re-engineered sound hardware, much longer battery life, and refined comfort and accessibility options.

Live Translation and Multilingual Communication
Live Translation allows seamless, real-time conversations across languages using on-device Apple Intelligence.

Users can trigger translation mode with a gesture on the AirPods, automatically lowering background noise, then hear translated speech directly in their ears.

If both participants wear compatible AirPods, each hears translations in their own language; if only one does, live transcriptions appear on the paired iPhone for the other person.

At launch, languages include English, French, German, Portuguese (Brazil), and Spanish (Spain), with Italian, Japanese, Korean, and Chinese (simplified) coming later in 2025.

#ai #airevolution #technology","with live translation powered by Apple intelligence.
Now, when you are together with someone who speaks a different language,
like exploring a market abroad,
AirPods Pro will help you understand them in your preferred language.
Using a new, simple gesture, live translation begins.
Translating Spanish, while ANC lowers the volume of the person speaking,
so it's easier to focus on the translation.
Hola, bienvenida.
Hey.
Hoy todos los claveles.
Hello, welcome.
Today all the red carnations are 50% off.
And it doesn't just translate individual words.
The meaning of each phrase is translated for you.
When you need to talk,
just speak naturally.
I'd love to take some of these to my sister for her birthday.
I'll buy eight, please.
Your iPhone displays your words in their language and can even read them out loud if needed.

The newly announced AirPods Pro 3 take everything you thought you knew about wireless audio and crank it up to a whole new dimension. Coming in at $249, these aren‚Äôt just earbuds anymore ‚Äî they‚Äôre a lifestyle device.

Highlights include:
	‚Ä¢	Live language translation ‚Äî no more awkward Duolingo streaks, just talk and let your AirPods do the work.
	‚Ä¢	Heart rate sensor ‚Äî your Apple Watch is shaking. Now your music isn‚Äôt the only thing keeping time, your AirPods will literally monitor your pulse.
	‚Ä¢	Concealable subwoofer design ‚Äî sleek, discreet, and absolutely wild. Apple engineers have reportedly solved the eternal problem of ‚Äúbass you can feel‚Äù by crafting a shape that‚Äôs both futuristic and‚Ä¶ highly interpretive.

Apple insists this form factor is the future, a blend of ergonomics and power. Early adopters are already calling it ‚Äúrevolutionary‚Äù while skeptics say it looks like something that belongs in a different aisle at the store. Either way, it‚Äôs impossible to ignore.

So whether you‚Äôre buying them for the sound quality, the health tracking, or just to flex at Starbucks, one thing‚Äôs certain: AirPods Pro 3 are here, and they‚Äôre not just headphones anymore ‚Äî they‚Äôre a statement.

The highlight feature is live language translation, allowing real-time conversations across multiple languages. At launch, English, French, German, Portuguese and Spanish are supported, with Italian, Japanese, Korean and simplified Chinese rolling out later this year. When both parties wear AirPods and are connected via iPhone, translations flow seamlessly.

I dropped nearly $2,000 on Apple‚Äôs latest flagship duo, the iPhone 17 Pro Max and the brand new AirPods Pro 3, and what I discovered shocked me.

From subtle build quality quirks to unexpected performance hiccups, these aren‚Äôt the seamless upgrades Apple promised. Are we starting to see the first real signs of Apple cost-cutting or supply-chain pressure? Or did I just get unlucky? ü§î

In this video I break down:
‚Ä¢ Real-world issues I‚Äôve run into after a few days of daily use
‚Ä¢ Why these problems feel different from the usual ‚Äúnew-product bugs‚Äù
‚Ä¢ What these flaws might mean for the future of Apple‚Äôs premium lineup

Whether you‚Äôre a die-hard Apple fan, a cautious upgrader, or just curious about the true experience behind the hype, this is a must-watch.

Took some time to finally unbox the AirPods Pro 3. 
Right away they felt lighter, more comfortable, and they actually stay put compared to the last gen.

Here are some highlights:

üîä Improved ANC with stronger noise canceling
üëÇ Transparency mode sounds way more natural
üé§ Mics are clearer for calls
üé∂ Bass hits a little heavier than before

It‚Äôs early, but these might just be my go-to for everything from work calls to late-night playlists.

Are you thinking of upgrading, or sticking with your current AirPods?

Well well well, yall know that it‚Äôs hard for me to hop on trends but if there‚Äôs an inexpensive way for me to try something AKA a ‚Äúdupe‚Äù and I can make it make sense for my lifestyle, I‚Äôm on board. I wanted some large, noise canceling earphones for the gym & didn‚Äôt want to pay my weight yet and seen someone share these‚Ä¶

check out my latest YouTube video for the full review but in short I love them because ‚¨áÔ∏è

1. They‚Äôre light weight 
2. Have great noise cancellation 
3. Loud enough for my liking‚Ä¶.

on top of that, they GIVE Apple AirPod Max..sorry not sorry they‚Äôre identical to meü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

https://www.instagram.com/reel/DN286GsWui3,nutrition,seckennedy,Robert F. Kennedy Jr.,"I‚Äôm leading a team at @hhsgov, along with @edsecmcmahon, targeting the woeful lack of nutrition education in medicine. We can reverse the chronic disease epidemic simply by changing our diets and lifestyles, but to do that, we need nutrition to be a basic part of every doctor‚Äôs training.","Hey everybody, I'm Robert F. Kennedy Jr., your HHS Secretary. Today, the Trump administration is demanding bold reform in our medical education system. I'm leading a team at HHS with the support of Secretary McMann at the Department of Education that targets a situation that everyone has long recognized as wrong, but no one has yet had the gumption to fix. It's the woeful lack of nutrition education in medicine. Poor diet drives America's chronic disease crisis, fueling seven of our ten deadliest conditions. Each year it claims an estimated one million American lives through diet-related illnesses. Meanwhile, we pour more than $4 trillion annually into treating these preventable diseases, and we continue to graduate physicians unprepared to confront their root cause. The good news is that diet not only causes these conditions, it can also prevent and reverse them. But for too long we've instead analyzed the chronic disease crisis, commissioned studies, and pontificated about the importance of nutrition without taking any meaningful action. Recent data reveals a critical disconnect. Although all medical schools claim to include nutrition in their curricula, most medical students report receiving no formal nutrition education throughout their entire training. This leads to a troubling reality. Most medical students recognize nutrition as necessary. Nearly all medical residents are asked to counsel patients about nutrition, but fewer than a quarter of practicing physicians feel adequately prepared to provide nutrition advice. We can reverse the chronic disease epidemic simply by changing our diets and lifestyles, but to do that, we need nutrition to be a basic part of every doctor's training. We'll start by embedding nutrition directly into college pre-med programs and testing it on the MCAT. Every future physician should master the language of prevention before they even touch a stethoscope. Under President Trump's leadership, we are going to systematically transform nutrition education throughout American medicine, from more than 200 of America's medical schools, 13,000 residency and fellowship programs, and ultimately each of the nation's 1.1 million practicing physicians. In the future, doctors won't just prescribe drugs, they'll be able to prescribe diets as well, confidently screening for diet-related diseases and collaborating with nutrition experts to recommend food-based solutions. Our reforms will save our country hundreds of billions of dollars and prevent millions of debilitating chronic diseases. This is an approach that is both radical and common sense. We're going to reconnect medicine with its roots. Hippocrates, the father of medicine, said, ""Let food be thy medicine, and medicine be thy food."" His advice remains true today, and we're bringing back food to its proper place in medicine.

https://www.instagram.com/reel/DEx3YSNv7H2,nutrition,drjessicaknurick,"Jessica Knurick, PhD, RDN","The U.S. food environment, healthcare system, and social determinants of health disproportionately harm low-income populations.

As a result, health outcomes like obesity, chronic disease, and life expectancy show staggering disparities. Men in the highest income groups live 15 years longer than those in the lowest, and for women, the gap is 10 years (PMID: 27063997). 

Improving the health of Americans means focusing on those struggling the most. It means policies that make nutritious food accessible‚Äînot $48 olive oil, but produce that millions of Americans in food deserts lack access to. Nearly 14% of U.S. households, including 1 in 5 children, face food insecurity, where they can‚Äôt consistently get the food they need to meet basic nutritional needs.

It means expanding healthcare access, funding nutrition programs, and addressing economic stability and other social determinants of health‚Äîevidence-based solutions that benefit everyone, not just the wealthy.

Any movement claiming to ‚Äúmake America healthy‚Äù while ignoring these systemic issues isn‚Äôt genuine. And when that movement is led by wellness influencers profiting from expensive supplements, detoxes, and cold plunge pools‚Äîrather than public health experts - it‚Äôs even less genuine.

Most things we were taught in the 70s and 80s were wrong. Nutrition is complex with every one having different metabolisms, hormones, etc. If you struggle with nutrition there is a lot of new information and its worth taking another look. Consider talking to a nutritionist or your physician ( make sure they are interested and up to date) 
If your gut is inflamed your joints will be inflamed. 
Your diet determines your weight, your exercise decides how you look at that weight
Eat mostly lean meats, fish, vegetables, and fruit. Decrease Sugar and processed carbs. 
You can‚Äôt outrun a bad diet
Genes play a role but bad habits do as well. Bad habits are often passed down through generations. Illness may run in your family because no one runs in your family. ( or eats well) 
Eat food that gives you sustained energy

Reducing intake of added sugars in our diets is the focus of the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans. A big reason for this focus is based on the finding that youth and adults in the United States consume twice the recommended daily amount of added sugars in their beverages alone.

Beverages such as sodas, some juices, energy drinks, sports drinks, and flavored water are a large source of added sugars. You'll also find added sugars in your flavored dairy products, baked goods, prepared sauces and dressings, and in some canned fruits.

It is recommended that we limit added sugars to 10% or less of our caloric intake per day, this is 50g based on a 2000-calorie per day diet. You can identify the amount of added sugar your food and beverages contain by referencing the nutrition facts label. As of 2021, these labels are required to identify added sugars in a product, separate from total sugars.

Here are a few tips to help you reduce the added sugar in your diet!
1. Move to more water - Cut one sugary drink out of your day and swap it for water! Need flavor? Add pureed fruit to make your water more tasty.
2. Read nutrition labels - Look at added sugars in the foods you eat and search for alternatives with less added sugars in them (i.e. no-sugar added barbecue sauce).
3. Replace sugar when baking - Use applesauce, banana, or sweet potatoes in place of sugar.
4. Make sauces and dressings from scratch - barbecue sauce, salad dressings, pasta/pizza sauce, and others can be made at home with less added sugar.

Increase your awareness of the foods and beverages you consume that contain added sugars and find one way to reduce the sugars in your diet this week.

The amount of sodium in the typical American diet definitely reaches these excessive levels. The average American eats about 3,400 milligrams (mg) of sodium a day‚Äîclose to 150 percent more than the daily limit recommended to avoid disease risk, 2,300 mg. Restaurant foods are a particularly concerning source of sodium for American consumers. Restaurant dishes contribute on average 31 percent of daily sodium consumption among adults and 26 percent among children.

We recently conducted a study that looked at the sodium content of menu items from the top 91 highest-grossing US restaurant chains, and found that many menu items at these large chains exceeded the daily recommended sodium value for US adults. This research also found excessive levels of salt hiding in unexpected menu items, like soups and salads that consumers might otherwise think are healthy, as well as sweet foods like desserts. Not ideal!

https://www.instagram.com/reel/CjLqjJDAcjH,nutrition,washingtonpost,The Washington Post,"Almost 60 percent of the calories that adults in America eat are from ultra-processed foods. They are what scientists call hyper-palatable: irresistible, easy to overeat, and capable of hijacking the brain‚Äôs reward system and provoking powerful cravings.

Yet in dozens of large studies, scientists have found that ultra-processed foods are linked to higher rates of obesity, heart disease, hypertension, type 2 diabetes and colon cancer. A recent study of more than 22,000 people found that people who ate a lot of ultra-processed foods had a 19 percent higher likelihood of early death and a 32 percent higher risk of dying from heart disease compared with people who ate few ultra-processed foods.

https://www.instagram.com/reel/DMiHlySpKDL,nutrition,springernature,Springer Nature,"Diet is the leading behavioural risk factor for death and chronic disease globally, and is the second such risk factor (after tobacco use) in older adults in the US. Understanding the relationship between diet and healthy ageing is important with ageing global populations. However, how dietary choices made during mid-life affect health in later years remains unclear. 

In a comprehensive analysis spanning three decades, Marta Guasch-Ferr√©, Anne-Julie Tessier, Frank B. Hu and colleagues identified specific dietary patterns that influence the likelihood of achieving healthy ageing, which includes maintaining cognitive, physical, and mental health beyond 70 years of age.

Eating a diet high in specific types of nutrients ‚Äî including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, unsaturated fats, nuts, legumes, and low-fat dairy products ‚Äî is associated with improved physical and mental health in older age. Meanwhile, greater intake of trans fats, sodium, sugary beverages, and red and/or processed meats was associated with poorer health in older age. 

The findings, based on an analysis of over 100,000 people in the US found that only 9.3% experienced healthy ageing and may help people improve their chances of living longer and healthier lives.
