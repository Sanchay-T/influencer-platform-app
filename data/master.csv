Here are a few “classical Pilates” exercises designed by Joseph Pilates for the Reformer. 

During World War I, Pilates, who was living in England, was interned as a German ""enemy alien"". He used this time to develop his fitness program, which he later called ""Contrology,"" focusing on mind-body connection and core strength. 

While in the internment camp, Pilates began teaching his fitness methods to fellow internees, and later, he worked as an orderly in a hospital on the Isle of Man, where he developed his apparatus by attaching bed springs to hospital beds to help rehabilitate patients unable to walk. 

The springs he used to help patients move and strengthen their muscles while bedridden became the inspiration for the iconic Pilates Reformer. 

After the war, Pilates returned to Germany and continued to study fitness and movement, eventually collaborating with experts in dance and physical exercise. He later emigrated to the United States, where he and his wife Clara opened a studio in New York City, where he worked with dancers and athletes. 

Today, Pilates is more popular than ever because it helps with everything. It’s one of the best workouts for your mind and body. Make sure you work with a certified Pilates teacher who has experience. 

🔸First Video: 
Footwork-“running or prancing”. I like to do a set with the pelvis neutral & another set with the pelvis lifted a few inches off the mat. The footwork exercises were meant to activate all the important muscles in our feet similar to acupressure. The feet are responsible for three quarters of our body & help with balance. 

🔸Second Video:
“The Shoulder Bridge” which is a great way to work your glutes and back while stretching the front of your hips and shoulders. Adding the magic circle and light dumbbells makes it even tougher. 

🔸Third Video:
“Feet in Straps”-Leg Circles are a favorite for most Pilates lovers because it massages our hips and feels amazing. 

🔸4th Video
“The Shoulder Bridge” w heels together toes apart.

Pilates is a gentle, low-impact way to build strength, improve balance, and boost flexibility—especially helpful for older adults looking to stay active and independent.

Regular practice can:
✔️ Reduce the risk of falls
✔️ Support posture and core stability
✔️ Ease joint and back pain
✔️ Improve everyday mobility

You don’t need fancy equipment to start—Pilates can be done on a mat, a reformer, or even from a chair.

Before beginning any new exercise routine, be sure to talk with your doctor to ensure it’s right for you.

@livewithkellyandmark was so much fun!

I had the opportunity to teach them a Pilates partner workout during their first week back on air (a sample of the workout that’s in your Lindywell app 🫶). 

They did an amazing job! (An so did Matt - he’s such a good sport ⭐)

The episode airs TODAY Friday 9/8 at 9 am your time! 

Leave a comment if you’re a Kelly and Mark fan or if you’re going to try to watch the episode!

I hope to go back soon! 😄

💥 Following safety protocol and instructor 
  cues

💥 Listening to your body 

💥 Knowing how to modify for your 
  restrictions/knowing your limits during that 
  class

💥 Having proper form and being open to
  corrections, do not muscle through

💥 Asking for a progression when appropriate

In this class there are 3 levels of difficulty for the same exercise. Side plank on the ground for those that may have shoulder issues and need a modification (or just not comfortable doing a side plank on the reformers just yet, but can do everytjing else during a level 2 class), side plank on the reformer with no movement, and side plank with movement for progression. 

Do you have any questions about being ready for a level 2 class 🙂🪷?

https://www.instagram.com/reel/DPgxyriEdLW,pilates workouts,bodylinela,Maria Leone,"One of the hardest moves I’ve ever done. It’s not a traditional Pilates exercise, but most of us consider this part of the work now—and for good reason. It’s a big strength move. To truly build strength, we must challenge and overload the body.

Notice how I’m moving my trunk through space. Instead  of flexing the spine, I’m treating this as a plank–side bend concept, adding the one arm push up takes this over the top.

Join me as I break this down in my Pro Class this week:

https://www.instagram.com/reel/C_qoeQFyL3F,pilates workouts,thepilatescenter,The Pilates Center,"“Above all, learn how to breathe correctly” - Joseph Pilates 

This quote emphasizes the foundational, life-sustaining power of breath, much like the natural forces depicted in Quinn’s sculpture series. 

@amyalpers used this archival exercise, which we nicknamed archival monkey, and a photo of Lorenzo Quinn’s The Force of Nature sculpture as ideas in her Advanced Reformer Class. 

Just as the sculptures convey nature's raw, dynamic energy, Joseph Pilates highlights the vital force of breath as the key to sustaining life and strength and bodying the power that flows through all movement and existence. 

There is nothing more poetic than witnessing Amy connecting, layering in the art and science of contrology within her classes through her understanding of Pilates and the world around her.

Join Amy at our Archival Weekend, October 3-5th, or just in classes in-person and online during the week.

5:30 a.m., abs on fire, and a decent cup of coffee nowhere in sight ☕🔥

Rooted, rising, and slightly questioning my life choices—but in the best way.

Apparently, getting a cup of coffee is a full-on adventure here: Unexpected café hours (who isn’t open on a Monday?), road closures, rain that never ends, and ZERO parking spots. 

I’ve almost accepted that my morning latte might just be a legend… like Bigfoot, or a Rainbow Unicorn.

But somehow, here I am—burning abs, chasing caffeine, and still thriving!

Michelle Leach and Alexa Idama have created two beautiful,  vibrant, welcoming Classical Pilates training studios in Atlanta. Both were active participants in many PSS workouts since its inception. 

What a joy it was to be able to connect ....IRL... touch, hug, honor, and appreciate each other and the work being accomplished, respectively, in the community.

Michelle and I have known and worked together since 2017. She moved to Atlanta  3 years ago, and this won't be the last time I visit her in this glorious space. 

I told Alexa there was no way I could travel to Atlanta and not pop in for a hug, kiss, and smile.... IRL, as we have only ""experienced"" each other via social media.

As you can see,  it was a TT weekend and so, meeting her in her new training center filled with a room full of apprentices, on the path to changing their lives and movement, was truly a special treat, for me as ""big sis.""

Having my brother and family with me to capture the moments with both of them was the icing on the cake. 

My heart is full. This was all I had hoped, planned and envisioned for the afternoon. 💛💛💛

https://www.instagram.com/reel/DOzaOEqDUrR,pilates workouts,sarah_bowmar,"SARAH BOWMAR, MBA CPT FNS 🇺🇸","After nearly 450 hours of formal Pilates training (almost three years of classes, three days a week - two reformer and one mat), plus daily 5–15 minute home practice and a dozen 1:1 sessions after having Dean to heal my diastasis, I am officially a certified mat Pilates instructor! ✨
-
I’ve completely fallen in love with the intentionality and flow of Pilates. It’s transformed not only my training but also my body: my strength in weightlifting has increased, my posture has improved (feet, ankles, glute balance, even scoliosis), and my diastasis has fully closed. My core has never looked better - I always joke that I have no business having an 8-pack after two kids just 19 months apart, but I credit it all to Pilates.
-
Pilates has also been a game changer for my pelvic floor strength and mind–muscle connection, which has carried over into everything - from better glute development, to improved core definition, to more confidence and yes, even incredible sex.
-
I’ll be sharing many of my favorite flows here, and they’ll also be part of my next challenge (starting October 13!). I can’t wait to bring these workouts to you in a more structured way. I know not everyone has access to in-person classes, so my hope is to help you experience the same love and benefits of Pilates that I have. 🙏🏼",,43112,https://scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/551394788_1129773238517955_1367176385620461238_n.jpg?stp=c0.248.640.640a_dst-jpg_e15_tt6&_nc_ht=scontent-atl3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=103&_nc_oc=Q6cZ2QEKEhzEmOHWcgc0S1aAYUw7C0YvXEUBljx-5DMUMPcD8iJl1jOoixnaj4BoOmlj470&_nc_ohc=QhoGt74Sm48Q7kNvwHLvbjD&_nc_gid=qhMBIRlzSZ1wK4_2fy4xKQ&edm=ANTKIIoBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfdcNvXZqmi2FBUJFmIjcqyvH4mkEfMgbDq2D1S5c94VGA&oe=68EECAB2&_nc_sid=d885a2,,,,2025-10-10T11:11:31.585Z,2025-10-10T11:12:00.565Z,hydrated

https://www.instagram.com/reel/DOZVGJ4iISR,airpods,daily_ai_smart_tools,Latest AI Tools | AI News | Technology Trends,"AirPods Pro 3 introduces a set of breakthrough features, including real-time live translation, new fitness sensors, re-engineered sound hardware, much longer battery life, and refined comfort and accessibility options.

Live Translation and Multilingual Communication
Live Translation allows seamless, real-time conversations across languages using on-device Apple Intelligence.

Users can trigger translation mode with a gesture on the AirPods, automatically lowering background noise, then hear translated speech directly in their ears.

If both participants wear compatible AirPods, each hears translations in their own language; if only one does, live transcriptions appear on the paired iPhone for the other person.

At launch, languages include English, French, German, Portuguese (Brazil), and Spanish (Spain), with Italian, Japanese, Korean, and Chinese (simplified) coming later in 2025.

#ai #airevolution #technology","with live translation powered by Apple intelligence.
Now, when you are together with someone who speaks a different language,
like exploring a market abroad,
AirPods Pro will help you understand them in your preferred language.
Using a new, simple gesture, live translation begins.
Translating Spanish, while ANC lowers the volume of the person speaking,
so it's easier to focus on the translation.
Hola, bienvenida.
Hey.
Hoy todos los claveles.
Hello, welcome.
Today all the red carnations are 50% off.
And it doesn't just translate individual words.
The meaning of each phrase is translated for you.
When you need to talk,
just speak naturally.
I'd love to take some of these to my sister for her birthday.
I'll buy eight, please.
Your iPhone displays your words in their language and can even read them out loud if needed.

The newly announced AirPods Pro 3 take everything you thought you knew about wireless audio and crank it up to a whole new dimension. Coming in at $249, these aren’t just earbuds anymore — they’re a lifestyle device.

Highlights include:
	•	Live language translation — no more awkward Duolingo streaks, just talk and let your AirPods do the work.
	•	Heart rate sensor — your Apple Watch is shaking. Now your music isn’t the only thing keeping time, your AirPods will literally monitor your pulse.
	•	Concealable subwoofer design — sleek, discreet, and absolutely wild. Apple engineers have reportedly solved the eternal problem of “bass you can feel” by crafting a shape that’s both futuristic and… highly interpretive.

Apple insists this form factor is the future, a blend of ergonomics and power. Early adopters are already calling it “revolutionary” while skeptics say it looks like something that belongs in a different aisle at the store. Either way, it’s impossible to ignore.

So whether you’re buying them for the sound quality, the health tracking, or just to flex at Starbucks, one thing’s certain: AirPods Pro 3 are here, and they’re not just headphones anymore — they’re a statement.

The earbuds come with improved active noise cancellation, an ergonomic fit designed from over 10,000 ear scans, better resistance to sweat and water, and even built-in heart-rate tracking. 

The highlight feature is live language translation, allowing real-time conversations across multiple languages. At launch, English, French, German, Portuguese and Spanish are supported, with Italian, Japanese, Korean and simplified Chinese rolling out later this year. When both parties wear AirPods and are connected via iPhone, translations flow seamlessly. 

Otherwise, they appear directly on the iPhone screen. Pre-orders are open now, and shipping begins on September 19, 2025, making them Apple’s most advanced earbuds yet.

https://www.instagram.com/reel/DPEsoFWgDK5,airpods,eurothrottle,EuroThrottle,"iPhone 17 Pro Max & AirPods Pro 3: My $2,000 Mistake? 🤯

I dropped nearly $2,000 on Apple’s latest flagship duo, the iPhone 17 Pro Max and the brand new AirPods Pro 3, and what I discovered shocked me.

From subtle build quality quirks to unexpected performance hiccups, these aren’t the seamless upgrades Apple promised. Are we starting to see the first real signs of Apple cost-cutting or supply-chain pressure? Or did I just get unlucky? 🤔

In this video I break down:
• Real-world issues I’ve run into after a few days of daily use
• Why these problems feel different from the usual “new-product bugs”
• What these flaws might mean for the future of Apple’s premium lineup

Whether you’re a die-hard Apple fan, a cautious upgrader, or just curious about the true experience behind the hype, this is a must-watch.

💬 Have you noticed similar problems? Drop your experience in the comments, let’s compare notes and see if this is a one off or a bigger trend!

Took some time to finally unbox the AirPods Pro 3. 
Right away they felt lighter, more comfortable, and they actually stay put compared to the last gen.

Here are some highlights:

🔊 Improved ANC with stronger noise canceling
👂 Transparency mode sounds way more natural
🎤 Mics are clearer for calls
🎶 Bass hits a little heavier than before

It’s early, but these might just be my go-to for everything from work calls to late-night playlists.

Are you thinking of upgrading, or sticking with your current AirPods?

Well well well, yall know that it’s hard for me to hop on trends but if there’s an inexpensive way for me to try something AKA a “dupe” and I can make it make sense for my lifestyle, I’m on board. I wanted some large, noise canceling earphones for the gym & didn’t want to pay my weight yet and seen someone share these…

check out my latest YouTube video for the full review but in short I love them because ⬇️

1. They’re light weight 
2. Have great noise cancellation 
3. Loud enough for my liking….

on top of that, they GIVE Apple AirPod Max..sorry not sorry they’re identical to me🤷🏾‍♀️

Did I mention they’re only $30!?

https://www.instagram.com/reel/DN286GsWui3,nutrition,seckennedy,Robert F. Kennedy Jr.,"I’m leading a team at @hhsgov, along with @edsecmcmahon, targeting the woeful lack of nutrition education in medicine. We can reverse the chronic disease epidemic simply by changing our diets and lifestyles, but to do that, we need nutrition to be a basic part of every doctor’s training.","Hey everybody, I'm Robert F. Kennedy Jr., your HHS Secretary. Today, the Trump administration is demanding bold reform in our medical education system. I'm leading a team at HHS with the support of Secretary McMann at the Department of Education that targets a situation that everyone has long recognized as wrong, but no one has yet had the gumption to fix. It's the woeful lack of nutrition education in medicine. Poor diet drives America's chronic disease crisis, fueling seven of our ten deadliest conditions. Each year it claims an estimated one million American lives through diet-related illnesses. Meanwhile, we pour more than $4 trillion annually into treating these preventable diseases, and we continue to graduate physicians unprepared to confront their root cause. The good news is that diet not only causes these conditions, it can also prevent and reverse them. But for too long we've instead analyzed the chronic disease crisis, commissioned studies, and pontificated about the importance of nutrition without taking any meaningful action. Recent data reveals a critical disconnect. Although all medical schools claim to include nutrition in their curricula, most medical students report receiving no formal nutrition education throughout their entire training. This leads to a troubling reality. Most medical students recognize nutrition as necessary. Nearly all medical residents are asked to counsel patients about nutrition, but fewer than a quarter of practicing physicians feel adequately prepared to provide nutrition advice. We can reverse the chronic disease epidemic simply by changing our diets and lifestyles, but to do that, we need nutrition to be a basic part of every doctor's training. We'll start by embedding nutrition directly into college pre-med programs and testing it on the MCAT. Every future physician should master the language of prevention before they even touch a stethoscope. Under President Trump's leadership, we are going to systematically transform nutrition education throughout American medicine, from more than 200 of America's medical schools, 13,000 residency and fellowship programs, and ultimately each of the nation's 1.1 million practicing physicians. In the future, doctors won't just prescribe drugs, they'll be able to prescribe diets as well, confidently screening for diet-related diseases and collaborating with nutrition experts to recommend food-based solutions. Our reforms will save our country hundreds of billions of dollars and prevent millions of debilitating chronic diseases. This is an approach that is both radical and common sense. We're going to reconnect medicine with its roots. Hippocrates, the father of medicine, said, ""Let food be thy medicine, and medicine be thy food."" His advice remains true today, and we're bringing back food to its proper place in medicine.

We’re seeking to raise the bar for stocking by: 
 
▪️Increasing variety requirements to seven per staple food category, more than DOUBLING the food choices required
▪️Closing loopholes that allow certain snack foods to count as staple foods
▪️Simplifying food classification, making standards easier for retailers to understand and @USDA_FNS to enforce
 
These changes will reorient SNAP towards better nutrition and emphasizing whole, healthy food for program participants.

https://www.instagram.com/reel/DEx3YSNv7H2,nutrition,drjessicaknurick,"Jessica Knurick, PhD, RDN","The U.S. food environment, healthcare system, and social determinants of health disproportionately harm low-income populations.

As a result, health outcomes like obesity, chronic disease, and life expectancy show staggering disparities. Men in the highest income groups live 15 years longer than those in the lowest, and for women, the gap is 10 years (PMID: 27063997). 

Improving the health of Americans means focusing on those struggling the most. It means policies that make nutritious food accessible—not $48 olive oil, but produce that millions of Americans in food deserts lack access to. Nearly 14% of U.S. households, including 1 in 5 children, face food insecurity, where they can’t consistently get the food they need to meet basic nutritional needs.

It means expanding healthcare access, funding nutrition programs, and addressing economic stability and other social determinants of health—evidence-based solutions that benefit everyone, not just the wealthy.

Any movement claiming to “make America healthy” while ignoring these systemic issues isn’t genuine. And when that movement is led by wellness influencers profiting from expensive supplements, detoxes, and cold plunge pools—rather than public health experts - it’s even less genuine.

Most things we were taught in the 70s and 80s were wrong. Nutrition is complex with every one having different metabolisms, hormones, etc. If you struggle with nutrition there is a lot of new information and its worth taking another look. Consider talking to a nutritionist or your physician ( make sure they are interested and up to date) 
If your gut is inflamed your joints will be inflamed. 
Your diet determines your weight, your exercise decides how you look at that weight
Eat mostly lean meats, fish, vegetables, and fruit. Decrease Sugar and processed carbs. 
You can’t outrun a bad diet
Genes play a role but bad habits do as well. Bad habits are often passed down through generations. Illness may run in your family because no one runs in your family. ( or eats well) 
Eat food that gives you sustained energy
Its not about living forever. The goal is to be as healthy as possible in your last decade

Eating healthy at work starts with a little prep and planning on the weekend! It can be tough to stay on track (especially at this time of year), however, it all starts with habit 💪 Here are some tips to help you eat healthier next week:

1. Pack Your Lunch: When you can, pack your lunch to control your ingredients and portion sizes (bonus, this also saves money!) 

2. Snack Smart: Rather than opting for chocolate or chips, keep healthy snacks on hand, like fruits, nuts, and Greek yogurt.

3. Stay Hydrated: Sometimes we can mistakes a food or coffee craving for actually just being thirsty! Drink plenty of water throughout the day (aim for 3-3.5L). 

4. Practise Mindful Eating: When you eat, put the tech away. Be truly present at meal times and pay attention to your body’s hunger and fullness cues.

Yet, the reality is that many students face food insecurity, often skipping meals due to financial strain. This affects not only their academic performance but also their physical health and emotional wellbeing.

Watch as a qualified dietitian shares practical tips for healthier eating on a budget and reminds us that nutrition is not a luxury, but a basic need that fuels education, health, and hope.

Reducing intake of added sugars in our diets is the focus of the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans. A big reason for this focus is based on the finding that youth and adults in the United States consume twice the recommended daily amount of added sugars in their beverages alone.

Beverages such as sodas, some juices, energy drinks, sports drinks, and flavored water are a large source of added sugars. You'll also find added sugars in your flavored dairy products, baked goods, prepared sauces and dressings, and in some canned fruits.

It is recommended that we limit added sugars to 10% or less of our caloric intake per day, this is 50g based on a 2000-calorie per day diet. You can identify the amount of added sugar your food and beverages contain by referencing the nutrition facts label. As of 2021, these labels are required to identify added sugars in a product, separate from total sugars.

Here are a few tips to help you reduce the added sugar in your diet!
1. Move to more water - Cut one sugary drink out of your day and swap it for water! Need flavor? Add pureed fruit to make your water more tasty.
2. Read nutrition labels - Look at added sugars in the foods you eat and search for alternatives with less added sugars in them (i.e. no-sugar added barbecue sauce).
3. Replace sugar when baking - Use applesauce, banana, or sweet potatoes in place of sugar.
4. Make sauces and dressings from scratch - barbecue sauce, salad dressings, pasta/pizza sauce, and others can be made at home with less added sugar.

Increase your awareness of the foods and beverages you consume that contain added sugars and find one way to reduce the sugars in your diet this week.

This corner of Instagram is for clinicians and dietitians who want to:

✅ Move past outdated advice like “eat less, move more”
✅ Get the facts behind nutrition trends & misinformation so you can give patients better, evidence-based advice
✅ Feel confident having real-world conversations that support (not shame) your patients

If you’ve ever thought…
👉 “I wasn’t taught how to handle these sensitive conversations in school.”

👉 “Patients already know the basics — they need more than another handout.”

👉 “I want to give advice that actually sticks.”

…then you’re in the right place.

Around here we:

Don’t demonize foods
Don’t shame patients for not eating organic
Use non-stigmatizing language
Meet patients where they are
Celebrate non-scale victories
Prioritize protein + fiber
Always start by listening first

I share practical strategies, scripts, and myth-busting insights to help busy clinicians have better nutrition conversations — even in short exam-room visits.

I’m glad you’re here. Follow for tips you can use right away and share this with a colleague.",,25,https://instagram.fadb9-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-15/557452170_1141462614125165_8372037514644018305_n.jpg?stp=c0.248.640.640a_dst-jpg_e15_tt6&_nc_ht=instagram.fadb9-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=105&_nc_oc=Q6cZ2QFRmfv_8ms-Y8imGY6iZCWfDLyo-MiBNhUyjtuwelqMj4byxKM-sUyLq9aUorUnrGs&_nc_ohc=whPeZYv_idAQ7kNvwFiDaKu&_nc_gid=09ny2PKQEFMHYEQEihWsuA&edm=ANTKIIoBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_Afeo05VmPw96lGvRDzHASg0SMZuG5s8tCtYQxxKRCBxLiw&oe=68EEC178&_nc_sid=d885a2,,,,2025-10-10T10:58:32.729Z,2025-10-10T10:59:19.585Z,hydrated

The truth? Some packaged foods have no business being in your body system. But because most people skip reading the labels, they unknowingly harm their bodies.

The amount of sodium in the typical American diet definitely reaches these excessive levels. The average American eats about 3,400 milligrams (mg) of sodium a day—close to 150 percent more than the daily limit recommended to avoid disease risk, 2,300 mg. Restaurant foods are a particularly concerning source of sodium for American consumers. Restaurant dishes contribute on average 31 percent of daily sodium consumption among adults and 26 percent among children.

We recently conducted a study that looked at the sodium content of menu items from the top 91 highest-grossing US restaurant chains, and found that many menu items at these large chains exceeded the daily recommended sodium value for US adults. This research also found excessive levels of salt hiding in unexpected menu items, like soups and salads that consumers might otherwise think are healthy, as well as sweet foods like desserts. Not ideal!

https://www.instagram.com/reel/CjLqjJDAcjH,nutrition,washingtonpost,The Washington Post,"Almost 60 percent of the calories that adults in America eat are from ultra-processed foods. They are what scientists call hyper-palatable: irresistible, easy to overeat, and capable of hijacking the brain’s reward system and provoking powerful cravings.

Yet in dozens of large studies, scientists have found that ultra-processed foods are linked to higher rates of obesity, heart disease, hypertension, type 2 diabetes and colon cancer. A recent study of more than 22,000 people found that people who ate a lot of ultra-processed foods had a 19 percent higher likelihood of early death and a 32 percent higher risk of dying from heart disease compared with people who ate few ultra-processed foods.

Nutrition and health columnist Anahad O’Connor (@anahad_oconnor) explains how you can spot ultra-processed foods in your grocery store — and what to eat instead.",,565305,https://instagram.fyei1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-15/497352637_1512054860203958_8605969553238243890_n.jpg?stp=c0.420.1080.1080a_dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08_tt6&_nc_ht=instagram.fyei1-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=102&_nc_oc=Q6cZ2QEIy-RS-TGNxT_LwNQ-BqYTXB-sNjX8rFTbpZJhh6VXG8S18hgpnzr-uyD2emOnglc&_nc_ohc=QfOmTfVwMl4Q7kNvwHr_3nx&_nc_gid=KsjN3pralnhNKQAPPRTN8Q&edm=ANTKIIoBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AffQSgd4cI-gxotjCE27W-iEWj9PSmbMHqMXVLvdPf3G5A&oe=68EEA0B6&_nc_sid=d885a2,,,,2025-10-10T10:58:32.729Z,2025-10-10T10:59:19.585Z,hydrated

That’s the reasoning behind recommendations that people take a “50-food challenge,” eating at least fifty different plant foods a week to achieve a diet diverse-enough to feed a vast spectrum of bacteria. 

This is a clip from my video series on Ozempic and other GLP-1 drugs. In this series, I present the pros and cons of these weight-loss medications so individuals can make up their own minds in the face of the very real and devastating consequences of obesity.

On NutritionFacts.org, the series will be released in nine longer videos on Mondays and Wednesdays. Check out see.nf/OzempicVideos to catch up on videos you may have missed.

All of the information in the Ozempic video series is also available in one place: OZEMPIC: Risks, Benefits, and Natural Alternatives to GLP-1 Weight-Loss Drugs, my book that is currently on sale for 20% off. It’s available in three formats—-an ebook, an audio book, and even a paperback. As always, all the proceeds I receive from my books are donated directly to charity.

https://www.instagram.com/reel/DMiHlySpKDL,nutrition,springernature,Springer Nature,"Diet is the leading behavioural risk factor for death and chronic disease globally, and is the second such risk factor (after tobacco use) in older adults in the US. Understanding the relationship between diet and healthy ageing is important with ageing global populations. However, how dietary choices made during mid-life affect health in later years remains unclear. 

In a comprehensive analysis spanning three decades, Marta Guasch-Ferré, Anne-Julie Tessier, Frank B. Hu and colleagues identified specific dietary patterns that influence the likelihood of achieving healthy ageing, which includes maintaining cognitive, physical, and mental health beyond 70 years of age.

Eating a diet high in specific types of nutrients — including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, unsaturated fats, nuts, legumes, and low-fat dairy products — is associated with improved physical and mental health in older age. Meanwhile, greater intake of trans fats, sodium, sugary beverages, and red and/or processed meats was associated with poorer health in older age. 

The findings, based on an analysis of over 100,000 people in the US found that only 9.3% experienced healthy ageing and may help people improve their chances of living longer and healthier lives.

It’s not a “beginners class” but I noticed once I caught on to the flow of class I was able to get into the groove. This is definitely a build on style class so the more you do it the more you understand the cues, moves, and can really turn up 💪🏽

Check out their variety of classes! In case you missed my mommy & me yoga video, they also have a parent-child yoga class on the schedule so check that out too!

Here’s a quick traction test of the Nike A’One “Pink A’ura”. Performance has been very consistent for me, while dust pick up is manageable with occasional wiping needed. Retailing at $110 USD, this will surely continue to be a very popular hoop shoe with the simple and appealing aesthetics.

Let me know your thoughts on the Nike A’One in the comments!

But now I'm back home, three weeks in, and I've had to rebuild from scratch.

My numbers are still low, but I've made progress. In just two weeks, I've already put on 10 pounds, and I've even started to get a little bit of my hops back. But the grind doesn't stop.

It’s probably less than you think, and decreases with age dramatically. 

I think/expect the % has increased since this 2020 report, but probably not by as much as I hope. 

It’s an excellent podcast, and while I don’t agree with everything shared it’s a huge overall net positive.

(If you want to lead yourself — and your training)
👇🏼

1. Hydrate & Fuel Right 💧🍳
Start with 500ml of water and electrolytes before coffee.
→ Better pumps, energy, and focus for your workout.
If you train early, add a light pre-workout meal — something that digests fast (like oats, banana, or whey).

2. Expose Yourself to Sunlight ☀️
10–15 minutes of morning light = natural testosterone boost, faster wake-up, better recovery rhythm.
→ Sunlight literally primes your body to perform.

3. Do Something Hard Right Away 💥
Cold plunge. Push-ups. Mobility flow. Anything that demands effort.
→ Train your brain before you train your body. Discipline is the warm-up.

4. Move Early 🏋🏼‍♂️
Even if you’re not hitting the gym yet — walk, stretch, activate your core.
→ Morning movement wakes up your nervous system and improves gym performance later.

5. Plan Your Training + Nutrition 🧠📱
Check your workout split. Prep your meals. Review your macros or log yesterday’s session.
→ Winners don’t wing it — they execute with a plan.

Not videoed, trap bar deadlifts, sets of 5 working up to top set of 355x5. Not my best but pretty good at 42 years old and banged up.
Then did a circuit of multigrip bar presses, weighted chins and shrugs. Presses/chins decreased by 10lbs each set, every set pushed to mechanical failure. Shrugs stayed constant at 225 for 10 reps.
Finished with some 45 degree back raises with a 25lb plate. 
Instagram probably won't show this because I caught some warnings yesterday for sharing videos of things actually happening in the world that go against mainstream narratives. Which coincidentally just makes me want to get fitter...and stuff.",,38,https://instagram.fscl29-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-15/558187302_823700126700238_8382685024614039713_n.jpg?stp=c0.80.640.640a_dst-jpg_e15_tt6&_nc_ht=instagram.fscl29-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=110&_nc_oc=Q6cZ2QEcWSmWFEPeLHFlCh4VOZ3CdrAKx_aQFecuZ4chPhysd9F7cH2jOtITVIYFYV7RIBU&_nc_ohc=bfcbfkZwb6IQ7kNvwGXkNpg&_nc_gid=YWablTSTTkOnBW9uDh_06w&edm=ANTKIIoBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_Afcs9j5WeoLEm4gEozDjDupHlTBGkgQ1L6iupRwW3Q2K_Q&oe=68EEC040&_nc_sid=d885a2,,,,2025-10-10T11:35:59.468Z,2025-10-10T11:36:50.625Z,hydrated
