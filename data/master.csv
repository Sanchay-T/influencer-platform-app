Here are a few ‚Äúclassical Pilates‚Äù exercises designed by Joseph Pilates for the Reformer. 

During World War I, Pilates, who was living in England, was interned as a German ""enemy alien"". He used this time to develop his fitness program, which he later called ""Contrology,"" focusing on mind-body connection and core strength. 

While in the internment camp, Pilates began teaching his fitness methods to fellow internees, and later, he worked as an orderly in a hospital on the Isle of Man, where he developed his apparatus by attaching bed springs to hospital beds to help rehabilitate patients unable to walk. 

The springs he used to help patients move and strengthen their muscles while bedridden became the inspiration for the iconic Pilates Reformer. 

After the war, Pilates returned to Germany and continued to study fitness and movement, eventually collaborating with experts in dance and physical exercise. He later emigrated to the United States, where he and his wife Clara opened a studio in New York City, where he worked with dancers and athletes. 

Today, Pilates is more popular than ever because it helps with everything. It‚Äôs one of the best workouts for your mind and body. Make sure you work with a certified Pilates teacher who has experience. 

üî∏First Video: 
Footwork-‚Äúrunning or prancing‚Äù. I like to do a set with the pelvis neutral & another set with the pelvis lifted a few inches off the mat. The footwork exercises were meant to activate all the important muscles in our feet similar to acupressure. The feet are responsible for three quarters of our body & help with balance. 

üî∏Second Video:
‚ÄúThe Shoulder Bridge‚Äù which is a great way to work your glutes and back while stretching the front of your hips and shoulders. Adding the magic circle and light dumbbells makes it even tougher. 

üî∏Third Video:
‚ÄúFeet in Straps‚Äù-Leg Circles are a favorite for most Pilates lovers because it massages our hips and feels amazing. 

üî∏4th Video
‚ÄúThe Shoulder Bridge‚Äù w heels together toes apart.

üí• Following safety protocol and instructor 
  cues

üí• Listening to your body 

üí• Knowing how to modify for your 
  restrictions/knowing your limits during that 
  class

üí• Having proper form and being open to
  corrections, do not muscle through

üí• Asking for a progression when appropriate

In this class there are 3 levels of difficulty for the same exercise. Side plank on the ground for those that may have shoulder issues and need a modification (or just not comfortable doing a side plank on the reformers just yet, but can do everytjing else during a level 2 class), side plank on the reformer with no movement, and side plank with movement for progression.

It‚Äôs not a traditional Pilates exercise, but most of us consider this part of the work now‚Äîand for good reason. It‚Äôs a big strength move. To truly build strength, we must challenge and overload the body.

Notice how I‚Äôm moving my trunk through space. Instead  of flexing the spine, I‚Äôm treating this as a plank‚Äìside bend concept, adding the one arm push up takes this over the top.

Join me as I break this down in my Pro Class this week:

This quote emphasizes the foundational, life-sustaining power of breath, much like the natural forces depicted in Quinn‚Äôs sculpture series. 

@amyalpers used this archival exercise, which we nicknamed archival monkey, and a photo of Lorenzo Quinn‚Äôs The Force of Nature sculpture as ideas in her Advanced Reformer Class. 

Just as the sculptures convey nature's raw, dynamic energy, Joseph Pilates highlights the vital force of breath as the key to sustaining life and strength and bodying the power that flows through all movement and existence. 

There is nothing more poetic than witnessing Amy connecting, layering in the art and science of contrology within her classes through her understanding of Pilates and the world around her.

Join Amy at our Archival Weekend, October 3-5th, or just in classes in-person and online during the week.

Michelle Leach and Alexa Idama have created two beautiful,  vibrant, welcoming Classical Pilates training studios in Atlanta. Both were active participants in many PSS workouts since its inception. 

What a joy it was to be able to connect ....IRL... touch, hug, honor, and appreciate each other and the work being accomplished, respectively, in the community.

Michelle and I have known and worked together since 2017. She moved to Atlanta  3 years ago, and this won't be the last time I visit her in this glorious space. 

I told Alexa there was no way I could travel to Atlanta and not pop in for a hug, kiss, and smile.... IRL, as we have only ""experienced"" each other via social media.

As you can see,  it was a TT weekend and so, meeting her in her new training center filled with a room full of apprentices, on the path to changing their lives and movement, was truly a special treat, for me as ""big sis.""

Having my brother and family with me to capture the moments with both of them was the icing on the cake. 

My heart is full. This was all I had hoped, planned and envisioned for the afternoon. üíõüíõüíõ

-
I‚Äôve completely fallen in love with the intentionality and flow of Pilates. It‚Äôs transformed not only my training but also my body: my strength in weightlifting has increased, my posture has improved (feet, ankles, glute balance, even scoliosis), and my diastasis has fully closed. My core has never looked better - I always joke that I have no business having an 8-pack after two kids just 19 months apart, but I credit it all to Pilates.
-
Pilates has also been a game changer for my pelvic floor strength and mind‚Äìmuscle connection, which has carried over into everything - from better glute development, to improved core definition, to more confidence and yes, even incredible sex.
-
I‚Äôll be sharing many of my favorite flows here, and they‚Äôll also be part of my next challenge (starting October 13!). I can‚Äôt wait to bring these workouts to you in a more structured way.

https://www.instagram.com/reel/DOZVGJ4iISR,airpods,daily_ai_smart_tools,Latest AI Tools | AI News | Technology Trends,"AirPods Pro 3 introduces a set of breakthrough features, including real-time live translation, new fitness sensors, re-engineered sound hardware, much longer battery life, and refined comfort and accessibility options.

Live Translation and Multilingual Communication
Live Translation allows seamless, real-time conversations across languages using on-device Apple Intelligence.

Users can trigger translation mode with a gesture on the AirPods, automatically lowering background noise, then hear translated speech directly in their ears.

If both participants wear compatible AirPods, each hears translations in their own language; if only one does, live transcriptions appear on the paired iPhone for the other person.

At launch, languages include English, French, German, Portuguese (Brazil), and Spanish (Spain), with Italian, Japanese, Korean, and Chinese (simplified) coming later in 2025.

#ai #airevolution #technology","with live translation powered by Apple intelligence.
Now, when you are together with someone who speaks a different language,
like exploring a market abroad,
AirPods Pro will help you understand them in your preferred language.
Using a new, simple gesture, live translation begins.
Translating Spanish, while ANC lowers the volume of the person speaking,
so it's easier to focus on the translation.
Hola, bienvenida.
Hey.
Hoy todos los claveles.
Hello, welcome.
Today all the red carnations are 50% off.
And it doesn't just translate individual words.
The meaning of each phrase is translated for you.
When you need to talk,
just speak naturally.
I'd love to take some of these to my sister for her birthday.
I'll buy eight, please.
Your iPhone displays your words in their language and can even read them out loud if needed.

The newly announced AirPods Pro 3 take everything you thought you knew about wireless audio and crank it up to a whole new dimension. Coming in at $249, these aren‚Äôt just earbuds anymore ‚Äî they‚Äôre a lifestyle device.

Highlights include:
	‚Ä¢	Live language translation ‚Äî no more awkward Duolingo streaks, just talk and let your AirPods do the work.
	‚Ä¢	Heart rate sensor ‚Äî your Apple Watch is shaking. Now your music isn‚Äôt the only thing keeping time, your AirPods will literally monitor your pulse.
	‚Ä¢	Concealable subwoofer design ‚Äî sleek, discreet, and absolutely wild. Apple engineers have reportedly solved the eternal problem of ‚Äúbass you can feel‚Äù by crafting a shape that‚Äôs both futuristic and‚Ä¶ highly interpretive.

Apple insists this form factor is the future, a blend of ergonomics and power. Early adopters are already calling it ‚Äúrevolutionary‚Äù while skeptics say it looks like something that belongs in a different aisle at the store. Either way, it‚Äôs impossible to ignore.

So whether you‚Äôre buying them for the sound quality, the health tracking, or just to flex at Starbucks, one thing‚Äôs certain: AirPods Pro 3 are here, and they‚Äôre not just headphones anymore ‚Äî they‚Äôre a statement.

The highlight feature is live language translation, allowing real-time conversations across multiple languages. At launch, English, French, German, Portuguese and Spanish are supported, with Italian, Japanese, Korean and simplified Chinese rolling out later this year. When both parties wear AirPods and are connected via iPhone, translations flow seamlessly.

I dropped nearly $2,000 on Apple‚Äôs latest flagship duo, the iPhone 17 Pro Max and the brand new AirPods Pro 3, and what I discovered shocked me.

From subtle build quality quirks to unexpected performance hiccups, these aren‚Äôt the seamless upgrades Apple promised. Are we starting to see the first real signs of Apple cost-cutting or supply-chain pressure? Or did I just get unlucky? ü§î

In this video I break down:
‚Ä¢ Real-world issues I‚Äôve run into after a few days of daily use
‚Ä¢ Why these problems feel different from the usual ‚Äúnew-product bugs‚Äù
‚Ä¢ What these flaws might mean for the future of Apple‚Äôs premium lineup

Whether you‚Äôre a die-hard Apple fan, a cautious upgrader, or just curious about the true experience behind the hype, this is a must-watch.

üí¨ Have you noticed similar problems? Drop your experience in the comments, let‚Äôs compare notes and see if this is a one off or a bigger trend!

https://www.instagram.com/reel/DPMErOOEQ9i,airpods,jonathan.hs_,Jonathan Hernandez,"Unboxing | @apple AirPods Pro 3
Took some time to finally unbox the AirPods Pro 3. 
Right away they felt lighter, more comfortable, and they actually stay put compared to the last gen.

Here are some highlights:

üîä Improved ANC with stronger noise canceling
üëÇ Transparency mode sounds way more natural
üé§ Mics are clearer for calls
üé∂ Bass hits a little heavier than before

It‚Äôs early, but these might just be my go-to for everything from work calls to late-night playlists.

Are you thinking of upgrading, or sticking with your current AirPods?

Well well well, yall know that it‚Äôs hard for me to hop on trends but if there‚Äôs an inexpensive way for me to try something AKA a ‚Äúdupe‚Äù and I can make it make sense for my lifestyle, I‚Äôm on board. I wanted some large, noise canceling earphones for the gym & didn‚Äôt want to pay my weight yet and seen someone share these‚Ä¶

check out my latest YouTube video for the full review but in short I love them because ‚¨áÔ∏è

1. They‚Äôre light weight 
2. Have great noise cancellation 
3. Loud enough for my liking‚Ä¶.

on top of that, they GIVE Apple AirPod Max..sorry not sorry they‚Äôre identical to meü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

https://www.instagram.com/reel/DN286GsWui3,nutrition,seckennedy,Robert F. Kennedy Jr.,"I‚Äôm leading a team at @hhsgov, along with @edsecmcmahon, targeting the woeful lack of nutrition education in medicine. We can reverse the chronic disease epidemic simply by changing our diets and lifestyles, but to do that, we need nutrition to be a basic part of every doctor‚Äôs training.","Hey everybody, I'm Robert F. Kennedy Jr., your HHS Secretary. Today, the Trump administration is demanding bold reform in our medical education system. I'm leading a team at HHS with the support of Secretary McMann at the Department of Education that targets a situation that everyone has long recognized as wrong, but no one has yet had the gumption to fix. It's the woeful lack of nutrition education in medicine. Poor diet drives America's chronic disease crisis, fueling seven of our ten deadliest conditions. Each year it claims an estimated one million American lives through diet-related illnesses. Meanwhile, we pour more than $4 trillion annually into treating these preventable diseases, and we continue to graduate physicians unprepared to confront their root cause. The good news is that diet not only causes these conditions, it can also prevent and reverse them. But for too long we've instead analyzed the chronic disease crisis, commissioned studies, and pontificated about the importance of nutrition without taking any meaningful action. Recent data reveals a critical disconnect. Although all medical schools claim to include nutrition in their curricula, most medical students report receiving no formal nutrition education throughout their entire training. This leads to a troubling reality. Most medical students recognize nutrition as necessary. Nearly all medical residents are asked to counsel patients about nutrition, but fewer than a quarter of practicing physicians feel adequately prepared to provide nutrition advice. We can reverse the chronic disease epidemic simply by changing our diets and lifestyles, but to do that, we need nutrition to be a basic part of every doctor's training. We'll start by embedding nutrition directly into college pre-med programs and testing it on the MCAT. Every future physician should master the language of prevention before they even touch a stethoscope. Under President Trump's leadership, we are going to systematically transform nutrition education throughout American medicine, from more than 200 of America's medical schools, 13,000 residency and fellowship programs, and ultimately each of the nation's 1.1 million practicing physicians. In the future, doctors won't just prescribe drugs, they'll be able to prescribe diets as well, confidently screening for diet-related diseases and collaborating with nutrition experts to recommend food-based solutions. Our reforms will save our country hundreds of billions of dollars and prevent millions of debilitating chronic diseases. This is an approach that is both radical and common sense. We're going to reconnect medicine with its roots. Hippocrates, the father of medicine, said, ""Let food be thy medicine, and medicine be thy food."" His advice remains true today, and we're bringing back food to its proper place in medicine.

https://www.instagram.com/reel/DEx3YSNv7H2,nutrition,drjessicaknurick,"Jessica Knurick, PhD, RDN","The U.S. food environment, healthcare system, and social determinants of health disproportionately harm low-income populations.

As a result, health outcomes like obesity, chronic disease, and life expectancy show staggering disparities. Men in the highest income groups live 15 years longer than those in the lowest, and for women, the gap is 10 years (PMID: 27063997). 

Improving the health of Americans means focusing on those struggling the most. It means policies that make nutritious food accessible‚Äînot $48 olive oil, but produce that millions of Americans in food deserts lack access to. Nearly 14% of U.S. households, including 1 in 5 children, face food insecurity, where they can‚Äôt consistently get the food they need to meet basic nutritional needs.

It means expanding healthcare access, funding nutrition programs, and addressing economic stability and other social determinants of health‚Äîevidence-based solutions that benefit everyone, not just the wealthy.

Any movement claiming to ‚Äúmake America healthy‚Äù while ignoring these systemic issues isn‚Äôt genuine. And when that movement is led by wellness influencers profiting from expensive supplements, detoxes, and cold plunge pools‚Äîrather than public health experts - it‚Äôs even less genuine.

Most things we were taught in the 70s and 80s were wrong. Nutrition is complex with every one having different metabolisms, hormones, etc. If you struggle with nutrition there is a lot of new information and its worth taking another look. Consider talking to a nutritionist or your physician ( make sure they are interested and up to date) 
If your gut is inflamed your joints will be inflamed. 
Your diet determines your weight, your exercise decides how you look at that weight
Eat mostly lean meats, fish, vegetables, and fruit. Decrease Sugar and processed carbs. 
You can‚Äôt outrun a bad diet
Genes play a role but bad habits do as well. Bad habits are often passed down through generations. Illness may run in your family because no one runs in your family. ( or eats well) 
Eat food that gives you sustained energy

Reducing intake of added sugars in our diets is the focus of the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans. A big reason for this focus is based on the finding that youth and adults in the United States consume twice the recommended daily amount of added sugars in their beverages alone.

Beverages such as sodas, some juices, energy drinks, sports drinks, and flavored water are a large source of added sugars. You'll also find added sugars in your flavored dairy products, baked goods, prepared sauces and dressings, and in some canned fruits.

It is recommended that we limit added sugars to 10% or less of our caloric intake per day, this is 50g based on a 2000-calorie per day diet. You can identify the amount of added sugar your food and beverages contain by referencing the nutrition facts label. As of 2021, these labels are required to identify added sugars in a product, separate from total sugars.

Here are a few tips to help you reduce the added sugar in your diet!
1. Move to more water - Cut one sugary drink out of your day and swap it for water! Need flavor? Add pureed fruit to make your water more tasty.
2. Read nutrition labels - Look at added sugars in the foods you eat and search for alternatives with less added sugars in them (i.e. no-sugar added barbecue sauce).
3. Replace sugar when baking - Use applesauce, banana, or sweet potatoes in place of sugar.
4. Make sauces and dressings from scratch - barbecue sauce, salad dressings, pasta/pizza sauce, and others can be made at home with less added sugar.

Increase your awareness of the foods and beverages you consume that contain added sugars and find one way to reduce the sugars in your diet this week.

The amount of sodium in the typical American diet definitely reaches these excessive levels. The average American eats about 3,400 milligrams (mg) of sodium a day‚Äîclose to 150 percent more than the daily limit recommended to avoid disease risk, 2,300 mg. Restaurant foods are a particularly concerning source of sodium for American consumers. Restaurant dishes contribute on average 31 percent of daily sodium consumption among adults and 26 percent among children.

We recently conducted a study that looked at the sodium content of menu items from the top 91 highest-grossing US restaurant chains, and found that many menu items at these large chains exceeded the daily recommended sodium value for US adults. This research also found excessive levels of salt hiding in unexpected menu items, like soups and salads that consumers might otherwise think are healthy, as well as sweet foods like desserts. Not ideal!

https://www.instagram.com/reel/CjLqjJDAcjH,nutrition,washingtonpost,The Washington Post,"Almost 60 percent of the calories that adults in America eat are from ultra-processed foods. They are what scientists call hyper-palatable: irresistible, easy to overeat, and capable of hijacking the brain‚Äôs reward system and provoking powerful cravings.

Yet in dozens of large studies, scientists have found that ultra-processed foods are linked to higher rates of obesity, heart disease, hypertension, type 2 diabetes and colon cancer. A recent study of more than 22,000 people found that people who ate a lot of ultra-processed foods had a 19 percent higher likelihood of early death and a 32 percent higher risk of dying from heart disease compared with people who ate few ultra-processed foods.

https://www.instagram.com/reel/DMiHlySpKDL,nutrition,springernature,Springer Nature,"Diet is the leading behavioural risk factor for death and chronic disease globally, and is the second such risk factor (after tobacco use) in older adults in the US. Understanding the relationship between diet and healthy ageing is important with ageing global populations. However, how dietary choices made during mid-life affect health in later years remains unclear. 

In a comprehensive analysis spanning three decades, Marta Guasch-Ferr√©, Anne-Julie Tessier, Frank B. Hu and colleagues identified specific dietary patterns that influence the likelihood of achieving healthy ageing, which includes maintaining cognitive, physical, and mental health beyond 70 years of age.

Eating a diet high in specific types of nutrients ‚Äî including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, unsaturated fats, nuts, legumes, and low-fat dairy products ‚Äî is associated with improved physical and mental health in older age. Meanwhile, greater intake of trans fats, sodium, sugary beverages, and red and/or processed meats was associated with poorer health in older age. 

The findings, based on an analysis of over 100,000 people in the US found that only 9.3% experienced healthy ageing and may help people improve their chances of living longer and healthier lives.

Yeah, fitness doesn‚Äôt have to hurt to work. It also doesn‚Äôt have to take a lot of time. In fact, starting slow and doing what you can is your key to lasting changes. 

You can start with 5 minute chunks and build on that as you‚Äôre ready, and Fit2b has veggies you need for every season and version of body you‚Äôre living in‚Ä¶ I mean, I‚Äôve had like 27 versions already üòù 

MEMBERS: Find this new workout in our A-Z path now + soon it will be on our Roku channel. 

Not a member yet?! Rates start as low as $5/month and we also have a sale happening now! 

Got ab issues like diastasis recti? That‚Äôs our specialty! Message me for some quick links to learn more. I‚Äôd love to chat (not a bot) üòâ

https://www.instagram.com/reel/DOezrkgjJdi,pilates workouts,jasminewentthere,Jasmine T.,"Back at @wanderlust_wellness_studio for their newest class: HEATSCULPT üî• (Mondays at 6:15 pm)

This was unlike any class I have ever taken! You know how in most classes your warm up eases you into it? Well in this class even the warm up was WORK! 

We moved for a full 60 minutes to the beat of the music with light weights and ankle weights. This class has a lot of combo movements and it was lowkey giving choreography! 

It‚Äôs not a ‚Äúbeginners class‚Äù but I noticed once I caught on to the flow of class I was able to get into the groove. This is definitely a build on style class so the more you do it the more you understand the cues, moves, and can really turn up üí™üèΩ

Check out their variety of classes! In case you missed my mommy & me yoga video, they also have a parent-child yoga class on the schedule so check that out too!

Here‚Äôs a quick traction test of the Nike A‚ÄôOne ‚ÄúPink A‚Äôura‚Äù. Performance has been very consistent for me, while dust pick up is manageable with occasional wiping needed. Retailing at $110 USD, this will surely continue to be a very popular hoop shoe with the simple and appealing aesthetics.

‚Äú20% of people have gym memberships. 50% of those people, use it. Now we are down to 10%. What percentage of them are doing resistance training‚Ä¶ maybe half.  So now we are down to 5% of people.‚Äù
- @michael_boyle1959 

We can debate plenty in our world today. One thing you can‚Äôt is that the number 1 avenue for lifespan and quality of life is resistance training. Our goal is always to have people leave feeling better than when they walked in.","Do we have a sense of what percentage of people in the United States do not practice resistance training? Well, we know that 50% of Americans are not training or doing any kind of exercise. I, from the research that I've read up until recently, um, it's probably 70% do not meet the criteria for both activities. 70% in total then? Or do you think it's 70% of people who are doing some form of exercise? Total. That's a great question. I believe that it is 70% of people in total. Got it. Okay. Is that I I can't even fact-check that, it's, I mean, that's hard for me to imagine, but I can believe it. I can believe it. I think it's lower, in terms of if you're talking about resistance training, 'cause we were talking. You would say lower than 30% would do resistance training then? Yeah, because I think 20% of people belong to a gym. If we look at home gym stats aren't very good in terms of people, they're the home gym person who actually has one and uses it is is probably more unicornie than we think they are. And so if you start looking at that number, 20% have a membership. 50% of those people use it, which now brings us down to only 10% of people in the United States are actually in a gym, and then you look at that and say what percentage of them are resistance training? Maybe now we're down to 5% because you see a lot more hamster wheel people who are just walking on a treadmill or walking on a stair climber or whatever it is. So, I would think the numbers are are pretty low. We spoke a little bit about this, but we have digital statistics that actually show people who have signed up to train with our programs, let's say, either be at home or at the gym, the percentage of people that make it through our programs is only 20%, and that's very high in terms of the industry standard. That's twice the industry standard for digital. Right. Which is usually like 10% or so. So, those are people who showed the commitment, made a purchase, put their hard-earned dollars behind it, have everything they need, I would think, in terms of the tools and sets and reps and what's supposed to be done, and only 10% will finish a program. So, I think that's that's a pretty uh, remarkable statement on what why why people can't. I think there's a lot more of a desire to to do things, but the the ability to actually follow through is where I think we're having the hardest time. So it might be then, Gabriel, your stat is 70% of 50, the reciprocal of that, 30% of 50, 15, it might be that our range is somewhere from 5 to 15% if I were going to sort of triangulate between these three data points. Again, that's that's kind of a hard thing to digest if you're asking the question, um, and and I've never been, um, sort of shy about my thesis, which is of all the pillars that we have, um, to embark on improving our health, whether it be changing our nutrition, improving our sleep, taking the medications and supplements that can be actually quite important, I don't I just don't see any evidence that anything trumps exercise, um, just purely from an actual lifespan perspective, and from the standpoint of reducing the risk of chronic disease. When you then layer in the benefits it has on quality of life, I mean, it's just sort of a no-brainer.",119,https://instagram.famm9-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-15/559144584_1163647902343250_2189855894655254816_n.jpg?stp=c0.248.640.640a_dst-jpg_e15_tt6&_nc_ht=instagram.famm9-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=102&_nc_oc=Q6cZ2QHl8-hjwvzFsURqdeNO18xskwCGVeuZuwO2AbP2GP4vzlcgqXD6fLRbfWgr4dkXXH8&_nc_ohc=Okle0XlRt5MQ7kNvwFIAs5z&_nc_gid=7auKZLt7TfjJq9AFU-7r-w&edm=ANTKIIoBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfejD1cWLuPjPsupGERXdwa5lG1S6LEpai3vymXae13l3Q&oe=68EEAF3A&_nc_sid=d885a2,,,,2025-10-10T12:06:36.069Z,2025-10-10T12:07:34.947Z,transcript_fetched

It‚Äôs probably less than you think, and decreases with age dramatically. 

I think/expect the % has increased since this 2020 report, but probably not by as much as I hope. 

It‚Äôs an excellent podcast, and while I don‚Äôt agree with everything shared it‚Äôs a huge overall net positive. 

@peterattiamd @michael_boyle1959 @drgabriellelyon @athleanx 

#fitness #strength #strengthtraining #strengthandconditioning #tonal #hypertrophy #fitover40 #exercise","a question that probably has an answer. Although I actually am a bit embarrassed to say I don't know the answer. So, I'm wondering if one of you guys do. Do we have a sense of what percentage of people in the United States do not practice resistance training? I was listening recently to the excellent Peter Attia podcast, round table discussion on resistance training and Peter opened with this question and the uh, panel audience uh gave some mixed answers in terms of what the data shows. So, I wanted to dive in and clean some of that up. This data is the most recent I'm aware of from the CDC from 2020 that shows that approximately 31% of the US adult population engages in the recommended two times a week of muscle strengthening or resistance training activity. And it also shows that about half of the population just under, uh, engages in the recommended aerobic activity, which is about 180 minutes of moderate, brisk walking activity. If you look at those that meet both the uh physical activity guidelines for strength training and also for aerobic training then that shrinks down to about 24% just under a quarter of your adult US population is meeting the overall guidelines. I actually think this data from the CDC is a little more interesting from a longevity focus. This is looking at the percentage of the US adult population that meets those physical activity guidelines for strength training and aerobic training, but it buckets it both by sex and by age. And so you can see in the big green graphs there that over 40% of men 18 to 34 meet those physical activity guidelines and just under 30% of women uh, 18 to 34 meet those guidelines. But what you see in both men and women is this very sharp decline in meeting the physical activity guidelines by age. So to the point where they're 65 and older only 15% of men or 10% of women are meeting those guidelines. Or set another way, 85 to 90% of people that age are not meeting those physical activity guidelines.",238,https://instagram.fbel17-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-15/553353236_782046518140562_277224038837766228_n.jpg?stp=c0.248.640.640a_dst-jpg_e15_tt6&_nc_ht=instagram.fbel17-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=102&_nc_oc=Q6cZ2QG7OtRluB-t_uo4tLHcPXHLxZFU9501Bf3HFMVIFZEsVSMEiA3CNYED9rG9POgswSI&_nc_ohc=3T25tSD-8zAQ7kNvwGF-A82&_nc_gid=JgHVlaSICV_bm4c86-7JPQ&edm=ANTKIIoBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfdgYS-WpjDSzPP1SoWKPbzLEtNO_aM_P3Hp7UbO_oOYTw&oe=68EEDF99&_nc_sid=d885a2,,,,2025-10-10T12:06:36.069Z,2025-10-10T12:07:34.947Z,transcript_fetched

(If you want to lead yourself ‚Äî and your training)
üëáüèº

1. Hydrate & Fuel Right üíßüç≥
Start with 500ml of water and electrolytes before coffee.
‚Üí Better pumps, energy, and focus for your workout.
If you train early, add a light pre-workout meal ‚Äî something that digests fast (like oats, banana, or whey).

2. Expose Yourself to Sunlight ‚òÄÔ∏è
10‚Äì15 minutes of morning light = natural testosterone boost, faster wake-up, better recovery rhythm.
‚Üí Sunlight literally primes your body to perform.

3. Do Something Hard Right Away üí•
Cold plunge. Push-ups. Mobility flow. Anything that demands effort.
‚Üí Train your brain before you train your body. Discipline is the warm-up.

4. Move Early üèãüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Even if you‚Äôre not hitting the gym yet ‚Äî walk, stretch, activate your core.
‚Üí Morning movement wakes up your nervous system and improves gym performance later.

5. Plan Your Training + Nutrition üß†üì±
Check your workout split. Prep your meals. Review your macros or log yesterday‚Äôs session.
‚Üí Winners don‚Äôt wing it ‚Äî they execute with a plan.

Not videoed, trap bar deadlifts, sets of 5 working up to top set of 355x5. Not my best but pretty good at 42 years old and banged up.
Then did a circuit of multigrip bar presses, weighted chins and shrugs. Presses/chins decreased by 10lbs each set, every set pushed to mechanical failure. Shrugs stayed constant at 225 for 10 reps.
Finished with some 45 degree back raises with a 25lb plate.

1. Exercise Daily for at least an hour. You do not have to kill yourself from running, jogging, etc., but you should have some sort of moderate physical activity in your everyday life.

 2. Eat the Right Foods and Portion Each Meal
No matter how bad your stomach is telling you to go for candy over healthy food, try to stay away from sweets.

 3. Keep Track of Calories and Food Intake Per Day
Keeping track of how many calories you eat in a day will be helpful in planning out your physical exercising.

4. Be Sure to Get Sleep
Even though most of us have eight-hour jobs during the day or night, it is crucial to get enough sleep to recharge the body's batteries.

 5. Stay Motivated
An important key to being in shape is to set goals and keep a positive mindset. If you stay positive, you will be able to push yourself to get that fit body you've always wanted.",,503,https://scontent-ams2-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/491457336_1618287665529635_1526012860500568189_n.jpg?stp=c0.420.1080.1080a_dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_sh0.08_tt6&_nc_ht=scontent-ams2-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=111&_nc_oc=Q6cZ2QEuwE1ARckT5NgXgJ4ZEJV08wweTwruU-L4Ij2RyJom1ABuaW6dSGPI9-lSgQRmpnU&_nc_ohc=6eQgDoeT1dkQ7kNvwEqiGcE&_nc_gid=eDf_h5T6mOkF1PbUU0KYmA&edm=ANTKIIoBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfepUAsjyGHXR4DxkMlJqOEu0blMwQbfaXkSjwucQdsHVw&oe=68EECFBA&_nc_sid=d885a2,United States of America,,,2025-10-10T12:06:36.069Z,2025-10-10T12:07:04.347Z,hydrated

But I feel stronger now than I have in a while.
I found a gym I love finally. Nash is way behind in the health space but it‚Äôs getting better! 
8am, 4‚Äì6 days a week: conditioning, lifting, Pilates, walking, hiking‚Ä¶ whatever gets me moving. And an added bonus, I‚Äôm way more productive when I start my mornings this way.

I used to chase skinny, and soft. Because it wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúcool‚Äù for girls to have muscle back then but I love my strength now. Almost as much as I love carbs üôÉ

Between jiu-jitsu, HIIT, weightlifting and running, I‚Äôve truly been able to create the necessary balance of mental and physical wellness required to drive my career in music.

Thanks to @blooplondon for the faith and support in letting me take this initiative forward, and to all the legends that came and ran today @joebloopldn @gabs__music @emile.909 @retza_ ü´∂üèº

The runs are free and open to anyone passionate about dance music: dancers, DJs, promoters, producers - anyone. So if you‚Äôd like to join just drop me a DM.

This run was soundtracked by @retza_ latest show on bloop üìª Go check it out on Soundcloud üëåüèº

Big love,

William ‚ô•Ô∏è

https://www.instagram.com/reel/C0-LlGVPy_B,nike fitness,totem_physique,5'10ish Amazon Fitness Goddess,"‚ú®üíñ Before I did ANYTHING, the first thing I had to do was  embrace this new journey of mommyhood‚ú®üíñ

üíñ Tip 1: Grant yourself grace ‚Äì celebrate small wins. In the whirlwind of new motherhood, it‚Äôs crucial to acknowledge and applaud your progress, no matter how small. 

‚ú®Example: Pat yourself on the back for consistent walks or completing a short workout; every effort is a victory.

üíñ Tip 2: Start with gentle walks, ease into weights. Your body underwent a miraculous journey, so introducing activity gradually is key. Begin with daily walks to boost energy and mood. As you feel ready, add lightweight exercises like bodyweight squats or resistance band workouts. 

‚ú® Example: Aim for 20 minutes of brisk walking three times a week, and add a simple bodyweight routine twice a week.

üíñ Tip 3: Nourish your body, and remember, self-care is non-negotiable. Prioritize nutrition to support your postpartum recovery. Include nutrient-dense foods like lean proteins, whole grains, and colorful veggies. Self-care isn‚Äôt selfish ‚Äì take a personal day to recharge, whether it‚Äôs a bubble bath, reading, or simply enjoying a quiet moment. 

‚ú® Example: Swap processed snacks for a balanced snack like Greek yogurt with berries, and schedule regular ‚Äòme time‚Äô for self-renewal.

Your well-being matters; keep shining, warrior!

Because listen‚Ä¶ intrusive thoughts are real. And sometimes the only thing between me and a felony (misdemeanor already acquiredü´£) is a good lift, a loud playlist, and some deep breaths between sets.

I work out because it‚Äôs how I manage stress, keep my mind clear, and avoid making impulsive decisions that can really be life changing.

During workouts, my thoughts quiet down. I process things better. My mood lifts. And I walk out feeling in control of myself again.

üëâüèº Exercise has been proven to reduce cortisol (your stress hormone), improve decision-making, and help regulate emotional outbursts.
üëâüèº Lifting weights helps release endorphins, dopamine, and serotonin aka your brain‚Äôs NATURAL mood boosters.
üëâüèº And consistent movement literally rewires your brain over time to manage pressure better. (Neuro plasticity‚Ä¶ thank you @hubermanlab for teaching me neuroscience)

So if you‚Äôre stressed hit the gym‚Ä¶ Because jail is not fun. Nobody likes metal toilets, no seats, and zero privacy.
