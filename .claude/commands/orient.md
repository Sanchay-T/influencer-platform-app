I just started a new session. Help me get oriented:

1. Read `agent_docs/monologue.md` - understand what was being worked on
2. Read `agent_docs/current-task.md` - understand immediate next steps
3. Check `git status` - see uncommitted work
4. Check `git log -5 --oneline` - see recent commits

Then give me a brief summary:
- What task is in progress
- What was last completed
- What's the next concrete step
- Any uncommitted changes I should know about
