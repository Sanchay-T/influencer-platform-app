I need you to help me find the perfect domain name for my agency business. But I want you to really think this through like a business strategist, not just throw names at me.

<My_Business_Context>
I'm starting a digital marketing agency focused on helping B2B SaaS companies with their content strategy and SEO. We're targeting mid-size tech companies ($10-50M revenue) who need to improve their organic traffic and thought leadership.
The vibe I want is professional but approachable - not stuffy corporate, but not too casual either. Think 'trusted advisor' meets 'creative partner.' We'll be offering services like content audits, SEO strategy, blog management, and executive ghostwriting.
I want the name to suggest expertise and results without being too literal (no 'TechSEOPro' type names). It should work well internationally since many clients will be US/Europe based. The name should grow with us - we might expand beyond just content/SEO later.
My competitors have names like ContentLab, Animalz, Draft.dev, and Siege Media. I want something that stands out but still feels credible when pitching to C-suite executives.
Budget-wise, I want a regular-priced domain, not premium. This is a bootstrapped startup so every dollar counts.

<Your_Task_Think_Out_Loud>

1. <First_Do_Some_Quick_Research>Look up successful agencies in similar spaces. What naming patterns work? Talk through what you're seeing. Think about agencies like Ogilvy, Pentagram, IDEO, Accenture - what makes their names work?</First_Do_Some_Quick_Research>

2. <Think_Like_Business_Owner>Actually vocalize your thought process as you evaluate each name idea. Say things like:
- *"Let me imagine answering the phone with this name..."*
- *"If I'm sending an invoice with this at the top..."*
- *"When someone types this email address..."*</Think_Like_Business_Owner>

3. <Test_Each_Name_Through_Scenarios>(think out loud!):
- Phone test: "*Good morning, [Name], how can I help you?*"
- Email test: "*Sure, it's contact@[domain].com*"
- Networking test: "*I run [Name], we help companies with...*"
- Word-of-mouth test: "*You should check out [Name], they're great at...*"
- Writing test: Is it spelled how it sounds?</Test_Each_Name_Through_Scenarios>

4. <Rate_And_Iterate>After each name, say why it works or doesn't. Like:
- *"Hmm, 'Synercore' sounds too tech-y for a creative agency..."*
- *"'Brightfield' - that's nice, easy to spell, sounds optimistic..."*
- *"Let me say this five times fast... yep, still rolls off the tongue..."*</Rate_And_Iterate>

5. <Generate_Lots_Of_Options>Create as many good names as you can think of (20, 30, even 50!). The more we check at once, the better our chances of finding available gems. Think through each one using the tests above.</Generate_Lots_Of_Options>

2. <Enter_All_Domain_Ideas>Click in that box and paste all your domain names. Enter as many as you generated - the more the better! One per line:
```
example1.com
example2.com
example3.com
[... all your names ...]
```</Enter_All_Domain_Ideas>

3. <Check_Settings>
- Price range slider should include all prices so you can see what's premium
- "Show Premiums" should be checked (blue checkmark)
- Make sure ".com" is selected in the TLD options</Check_Settings>

4. <Click_Generate_Button>Click the big green "Generate" button and wait for results to load</Click_Generate_Button>

5. <Analyze_Results>When results appear, you'll see:
- Available domains with regular pricing (usually ₹971.64/year or ~$12)
- Premium domains with higher prices
- Taken domains (unavailable)</Analyze_Results>

6. <Think_Through_Results>(out loud again!):
- *"Okay, 'brightfield.com' is available at regular price - that's perfect!"*
- *"'Silvermark.com' is premium at ₹50,000 - too expensive, let's skip"*
- *"'Foundryco.com' is taken - shame, that was a good one"*</Think_Through_Results>

7. <Make_Final_Decisions>
- From all available regular-priced domains, pick the absolute best 3-5
- Consider: Which passed all your earlier tests? Which feel most "right"?
- Think: *"If I had to live with this name for 10 years..."*</Make_Final_Decisions>

8. <Add_To_Cart>For each chosen domain:
- Look for the shopping cart icon next to the domain name in the results
- Click it to add to cart
- You should see a confirmation that it's been added</Add_To_Cart>

9. <Final_Summary>Tell me:
- Your top 3 picks and why they won
- What's in the cart
- Any close runners-up worth considering</Final_Summary>

Remember - I want to hear your actual thought process throughout. Don't just list names or mechanically follow steps. Think like you're choosing the name that will represent your business for the next decade. Talk it through!
