# WT‑2 Changes and Current State (Working Snapshot)

This document captures everything implemented and adjusted in this session so the next iteration can continue without rediscovery. It reflects the final, working state now in the repository.

## Objectives Achieved
- Single, non-duplicated “Create Campaign” CTA with plan gating.
- Dynamic campaign counts based on actual plan limits/usage.
- Simple, robust access control: full-screen blocking overlay on app pages; Billing/Pricing left accessible.
- Clean upgrade flow via Stripe Checkout (payment completes on Stripe; plan updates via webhook).
- Simplified middleware to auth-only; no cookie-based gating or redirect loops.
- Fixed build/runtime issues (bad env line, fs in client, Clerk key in layout).

## Key UX/Behavior
- Header CTA
  - Shows “Create Campaign” when allowed, else “Upgrade”.
  - Only one CTA lives in the header (no duplicates on the page).
- Usage/Counts
  - Dashboard header shows “used/limit” or “used” if unlimited, sourced from `/api/billing/status`.
- Access Control (final, simplest form)
  - Blocking overlay appears across dashboard/campaign pages when trial expired or no active subscription.
  - Billing (`/billing`) and Pricing (`/pricing`) are never blocked.
  - No middleware redirects based on plan; overlay handles UX consistently.
- Upgrades
  - Clicking Upgrade redirects to Stripe Checkout (new subscription or plan-change), not the customer portal.
  - After payment, Stripe webhook updates DB; overlay disappears once `/api/billing/status` reflects access.

## File-Level Summary (by area)

1) Campaigns UI and Counts
- `app/components/layout/dashboard-header.jsx`: Removed duplicate tab; removed “Influencers”; added header CTA gating via `/api/billing/status`.
- `app/page.js`: Switched counts to `/api/billing/status` (shows used/limit or used if unlimited).
- `app/components/campaigns/CampaignList.jsx`: No structural change; grid/filters retained.

2) Access Control (Overlay)
- `app/components/billing/access-guard-overlay.tsx`: Final behavior is a full-screen blocking dialog with blurred backdrop and CTAs.
- `app/components/layout/dashboard-layout.jsx`: Client-only shell; renders overlay globally; no server-only imports.

3) Middleware (Simplified)
- `middleware.ts`: Auth-only and webhook/admin exceptions. Removed `gx_access` cookie checks and redirects. Root `/` public again.

4) Billing Status — One Source of Truth
- `app/api/billing/status/route.ts`: Returns JSON only (plan, trial, usage). No cookies/side effects.

5) Upgrade Flow (Stripe Checkout)
- `app/api/stripe/checkout-upgrade/route.ts` (new): Creates Checkout sessions to upgrade existing subs or start new paid subs. Returns `{ url }` for redirect.
- `app/components/billing/upgrade-button.tsx`: Redirects to Checkout via the new endpoint.
- `lib/stripe/stripe-service.ts`: Earlier added `expand: ['latest_invoice.payment_intent']` in `updateSubscription`; harmless with Checkout flow.

6) Logging, Build Fixes, and Safety
- `lib/utils/onboarding-logger.ts`: Removed Node `fs` from shared module; client posts to API, server logs to console.
- `app/api/logs/onboarding/route.ts` (new): Simple file-backed logging endpoint for onboarding logs (dev tooling).
- `app/layout.tsx`: Avoids inlining publishable key; `ClerkProvider` reads env itself.
- `.env.local`: Fixed malformed QStash/TEST var concatenation.

## Endpoints Added/Modified
- Added: `POST /api/stripe/checkout-upgrade` → `{ url }` stripe checkout URL
- Modified: `GET /api/billing/status` → JSON only, no cookies
- Added: `/api/logs/onboarding` (POST/GET/DELETE) for optional dev logging

## Testing Guide
- Overlay gating
  - Expired/no sub → `/` or `/dashboard` shows blocking modal; `/billing` does not.
- Upgrade
  - Upgrade button → Stripe Checkout → pay → return to `/billing` → webhook updates DB → overlay disappears on app pages.
- Header CTA + counts
  - Counts reflect `/api/billing/status`; CTA switches to Create vs Upgrade accordingly.

## Rationale for Final Simplicity
- One guard (overlay), one source (`/api/billing/status`), one upgrade path (Checkout).
- No cookies/redirect loops; fewer moving parts; easy to extend.

## Notes / Future Considerations
- Optional: Banner on Billing when `redirect_url` is present (clarify why user landed there).
- Optional: Small poll after Checkout success to reflect activation before webhook delay during dev.
- Optional: Stripe-backed status reconciliation if DB is stale (only if needed).
