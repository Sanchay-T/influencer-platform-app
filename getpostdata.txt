3. Get Post Data with Engagement Metrics
This endpoint allows you to retrieve detailed metrics for a specific social media post. You need to specify the platform, the type of content, and provide the unique ID of the post you want to track. If a post has a large number of interactions, you can use the optional pagination token to fetch additional data in multiple requests.

The response will include information about the users engaging with the post, including likes, comments, and shares. It also provides timestamps and links to the post, along with a pagination token when more data is available. This makes it easy to monitor post performance and track engagement over time.
