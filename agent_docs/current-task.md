**Task:** Setting up CLAUDE.md and agent documentation structure
**Branch:** `feed/small-fixes`
**Status:** In progress
**Started:** Dec 4, 2025

## What You're Doing

- Created CLAUDE.md with project overview, user journey, commands, rules
- Created agent_docs/ with code-patterns, database, testing-verification
- Setting up session continuity system (current-task + session-history)

## Current State

- [x] CLAUDE.md created and refined
- [x] Git workflow documented
- [x] Session continuity files created
- [ ] Remaining placeholder docs (architecture, onboarding-flow, etc.)

## Context You Need

- All docs written in "you" tone (speaking directly to the agent)
- Git: auto-commit/push to feature branch, merge only after user approval
- Scratchpad updates tied to commits (autonomous context management)

## Blockers

None

## Next Steps

- User to review the setup
- Create remaining agent_docs/ placeholder files if needed
