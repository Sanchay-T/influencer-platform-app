## Current Task

**ID:** TASK-008
**Title:** Fix Search Progress UX — Keyword Search Reliability
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE — Clean Architecture Refactor Done
**Branch:** `fix/search-progress-ux`
**Started:** Dec 30, 2025
**Completed:** Jan 01, 2026 — 06:25 PM
**Latest Commits:** Phase 2 Clean Architecture Refactor (47+ state values → 12, 7 loading indicators → 1)

### Goal
Fix the keyword search progress UI that breaks in production. Backend returns 1000 creators correctly, but frontend gets stuck with partial results (200-800), spinners that never stop, and requires full browser refresh to see correct data.

### Root Causes Identified
1. **Two independent polling loops + duplicate state = sync failure** (FIXED)
   - SearchProgress had its own polling loop
   - useCampaignJobs had its own polling loop  
   - useCreatorSearch had duplicate state
   - These never synced with each other

2. **Enrichment phase UX "slop"** (FIXED in 2e3bd8e55)
   - Status stays "enriching" even after all creators found
   - Spinner keeps running with no explanation
   - User doesn't know what's happening

3. **2-minute completion delay** (FIXED in 9d6c83e42)
   - Status API only called checkStaleAndComplete() which requires 2-min staleness
   - Enrichment workers' checkAndComplete() missed due to counter race conditions
   - Jobs waited 2 minutes even when 100% enriched
   - Fix: Status API now calls checkAndComplete() first for immediate completion

### Solution Implemented: Unified React Query Architecture

**Created single source of truth using React Query:**

```
useJobPolling (React Query) ──polls──► React Query Cache
                                            │
                    ┌───────────────────────┼───────────────────────┐
                    ↓                       ↓                       ↓
              Main Content              Sidebar               Progress Bar
              (reads cache)          (reads cache)          (reads cache)
```

### Latest Work Completed
**Full refactor to unified state architecture:**

1. ✅ **Enhanced useJobStatus hook** (`lib/query/hooks/useJobStatus.ts`)
   - Added V2 status types (searching, enriching, dispatching, etc.)
   - Added helper flags: isTerminal, isActive, isSuccess
   - Added query key exports for cache invalidation
   - Progress automatically capped at 100%

2. ✅ **Created useJobPolling hook** (`lib/query/hooks/useJobPolling.ts`) — NEW
   - Single polling source using React Query
   - Callbacks for onProgress and onComplete events
   - Automatic cache invalidation on completion
   - Stops polling on terminal states

3. ✅ **Refactored SearchProgress** (`search-progress.jsx`)
   - Removed 300+ lines of custom polling loop
   - Now uses useJobPolling hook
   - Progress capped at 100%

4. ✅ **Refactored useCreatorSearch** (`hooks/useCreatorSearch.ts`)
   - Removed duplicate state (stillProcessing, serverTotalCreators, completedStatus)
   - Now derives values from React Query (single source of truth)
   - Fixed spread accumulator performance issue

5. ✅ **Refactored useCampaignJobs** (`hooks/useCampaignJobs.ts`)
   - Removed 120+ lines of custom setInterval polling loop
   - Now uses useJobPolling hook
   - Syncs job state from React Query cache

6. ✅ **Fixed progress bar cap** (`RunSummary.tsx`)
   - Progress capped at 100% with Math.min()

7. ✅ **Build verified** — No type errors

**Follow-up fixes after initial deployment:**

8. ✅ **Fixed infinite render loop** (Commit `a676eb689`)
   - useJobPolling was triggering re-renders in dependency array
   - Wrapped callbacks in useCallback to stabilize references
   - Prevented infinite polling loops

9. ✅ **Added diagnostic logging** (Commit `0e8eb3793`)
   - Added console logs to track polling state transitions
   - Logs job status, progress, and terminal state detection
   - Helps debug production issues

10. ✅ **Fixed enrichment UX slop** (Commit `2e3bd8e55`)
    - Added enrichment-specific stage messaging in computeStage()
    - Now shows: "Found 1198 creators • Enriching data (847/1198)"
    - User understands why spinner is running after creators are found

11. ✅ **Fixed 2-minute completion delay** (Commit `9d6c83e42`)
    - Status API now calls checkAndComplete() first (immediate completion if 100% enriched)
    - Falls back to checkStaleAndComplete() (2-min stale timeout with 80%+ enriched)
    - Jobs complete immediately when fully enriched instead of waiting 2 minutes

12. ✅ **DB-driven job completion** (Commit `da2a3ab69`)
    - Added getActualEnrichmentState() — queries actual job_creators table
    - checkAndComplete() now uses COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE bioEnriched) instead of counters
    - checkStaleAndComplete() also updated to use DB state
    - Reduced stale timeout from 2min to 30sec (counter sync no longer needed)
    - Eliminates race conditions from parallel QStash workers

13. ✅ **Added indexed enriched column** (Commit `9cd30aaf8`)
    - Added `enriched` boolean column to job_creators table
    - Added composite index (jobId, enriched) for fast COUNT queries
    - Updated enrich-worker to set column when enriching
    - Updated getActualEnrichmentState() to use column instead of JSON extraction

14. ✅ **Supabase Realtime for instant updates** (Commit `36b9a441f`)
    - Enabled Realtime on scraping_jobs table (SQL)
    - Set REPLICA IDENTITY FULL for full row data
    - Created lib/supabase/client.ts for browser-side client
    - Created useJobRealtime hook for WebSocket subscriptions
    - Updated useJobPolling to use Realtime with polling fallback
    - UI now updates instantly (no 2s polling delay)

15. ✅ **DB-driven enrichment count in status API** (Commit `d4189a3bf`)
    - Status API now queries actual COUNT(*) WHERE enriched=true
    - Replaces stale counter columns that lag behind due to race conditions
    - Counter discrepancy was significant: 347 vs 407 enriched (60 behind)

16. ✅ **Fix 15-second loading delay for completed runs** (Commit `d84c4954d`)
    - Increased server pre-load from 50 to 200 creators
    - Disabled auto-fetch all pages by default (use pagination instead)
    - Users now see 200 creators instantly, can paginate for more

17. ✅ **Fix on-demand pagination fetching** (Commit `2d5555c0b`)
    - When user navigates beyond loaded creators, fetch page from server
    - Shows loading state while fetching
    - Pagination now works correctly for 1000+ creator runs

18. ✅ **Disable duplicate client-side enrichment** (Commit `6fd8adacb`)
    - V2 enrich-workers already handle enrichment server-side
    - Client-side useBioEnrichment was writing to wrong table (scraping_results)
    - UI reads from job_creators table, so client enrichment was wasted
    - Saves ~$1.88 per 1000 creators (no more duplicate API calls)

19. ✅ **Fix CreatorSnapshot type for list saving** (Commit `6fd8adacb`)
    - Re-export type from AddToListButton to ensure compatibility
    - Previous type was missing required `externalId` field
    - This caused silent failures when saving creators to lists

20. ✅ **Improved platform detection + debug logging** (Commit `b0ff6709e`)
    - Enhanced bio enrichment platform detection logic
    - Added debug logging for bio enrichment process
    - Better error handling for platform mismatches

21. ✅ **Remove unscalable per-creator enrichment API calls** (Commit `69758761f`)
    - Removed client-side enrichment completely (was duplicating server work)
    - Server-side V2 enrich-workers handle all enrichment
    - Significant cost savings (~$1.88 per 1000 creators)

22. ✅ **Cleanup dead code** (Commit `75417b1b4`, `a83e7a2a1`)
    - Removed references to undefined platform variables
    - Removed leftover setHasFetchedComplete reference
    - Code cleanup after refactoring

23. ✅ **Re-enable client enrichment as fallback** (Commit `019e23917`)
    - Added fallback for old runs without bio_enriched field
    - Ensures backward compatibility with legacy data
    - Only runs for old data, new runs use server enrichment

24. ✅ **Clean Architecture Refactor** (Jan 01, 2026)
    - Added `message` field to Status API (human-readable from backend)
    - Created `useSearchJob` hook (single source of truth)
    - Created `ProgressDisplay` component (simple, stateless)
    - Rewrote `search-results.jsx` (500+ lines → 200 lines)
    - Deleted: `useBioEnrichment.ts`, `useAutoFetchAllPages.ts`, `useCreatorSearch.ts`
    - Before: 47+ state values, 7 loading indicators, 4 progress sources
    - After: ~12 state values, 1 loading indicator, 1 progress source (API)

### Next Action
```
🚀 SUBMIT DELAY FIX DEPLOYED — TEST ON sorz.ai

Status:
- Branch: fix/search-progress-ux → deploys to sorz.ai
- Fixed: Submit campaign delay + double-click issue

What was fixed:
- Added isSubmitting state at page level (prevents double submission)
- Added loading overlay during submission (visual feedback)
- Passed isSubmitting to KeywordReview to disable button
- Added detailed timing logs for debugging

IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS:
1. Test on sorz.ai:
   - Go to a campaign → Keyword Search
   - Add keywords and click "Submit Campaign"
   - VERIFY: Loading overlay appears immediately
   - VERIFY: Button is disabled (no double-click possible)
   - VERIFY: Navigation to run page happens after API returns
   - Check browser console for timing logs: [GEMZ-SUBMIT] and [GEMZ-DISPATCH]

2. If issues persist, check console logs:
   - [GEMZ-SUBMIT] 🚀 Starting submit... → when button clicked
   - [GEMZ-SUBMIT] 📡 Calling /api/v2/dispatch... → before fetch
   - [GEMZ-SUBMIT] ✅ Dispatch response received → after fetch with timing
   - [GEMZ-SUBMIT] 🎯 Navigating to campaign page → before router.push
   - [GEMZ-DISPATCH] ⏱️ Timing breakdown → server-side timing

3. If everything works on sorz.ai:
   git checkout main
   git merge fix/search-progress-ux
   git push origin main
```
