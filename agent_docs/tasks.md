## Current Task

**ID:** TASK-015
**Title:** Fix 10 Remaining Issues (CSV security + regression tests)
**Status:** COMPLETE
**Branch:** `fix/remaining-10-issues`
**Started:** Feb 7, 2026
**Last Updated:** Feb 7, 2026

### Summary
Deep scan found 10 issues post business-logic-fixes. 9 of 10 were already fixed in commit `24a6d1952`. Issue #5 (CSV public blob access) was already mitigated via defense-in-depth — Vercel Blob does not support private access (`access: 'public'` is the only option). Existing mitigations: auth-protected download proxy, UUID tokens in filenames, raw blob URLs never exposed to clients.

**What was done:**
- **#5 verification:** Confirmed `@vercel/blob` (v1.1.1 through v2.2.0) does not support `access: 'private'`. Defense-in-depth already in place: status endpoint → `/api/export/download/[id]` proxy → auth+ownership check → 302 redirect to blob. QStash response omits blob URL.
- **Test: webhook plan detection** — verifies plan upgrade is detected when sub ID and status stay the same (3 tests)
- **Test: image proxy SSRF** — verifies private IP blocking and domain allowlist (9 tests)
- **Test: CSV blob upload** — verifies blob put is called with correct options (1 test)

**Files changed:**
- `app/api/export/csv-worker/route.ts` — Updated comment (removed stale TODO, documented security approach)
- `app/api/export/status/[id]/route.ts` — Returns proxy download URL instead of raw blob URL
- `app/api/export/download/[id]/route.ts` — New auth-protected download endpoint
- `lib/billing/webhook-handlers.test.ts` — New test file
- `app/api/proxy/image/route.test.ts` — New test file
- `app/api/export/csv-worker/route.test.ts` — New test file
- `agent_docs/remaining-issues-2026-02-07.md` — Documented all 10 issues status

**Documentation:** `agent_docs/remaining-issues-2026-02-07.md`
**Tests:** 31 passing across 11 test files
**Verification:** `pnpm test` green, `pnpm typecheck` no new errors (pre-existing errors in unrelated files)

---

## Previous Task

**ID:** TASK-014
**Title:** Business Logic Fixes (10 bugs)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE (ready to commit)
**Branch:** `main` (or create `fix/business-logic-fixes`)
**Started:** Feb 7, 2026
**Last Updated:** Feb 7, 2026

### Summary
Deep-scan audit found 10 real bugs affecting billing accuracy, data integrity, and UX. All fixed with 18 regression tests against the real dev DB. Test infrastructure (vitest) recreated from scratch.

**What was done:**
- **Fix A:** Campaign creation atomicity — wrapped insert + counter in single transaction
- **Fix B:** Enrichment counter never incremented — wired incrementEnrichmentCount after persist
- **Fix C:** can-create log metadata said "fail-open" but code was fail-closed
- **Fix D:** refreshListStats race condition — moved inside transactions
- **Fix E:** addCreatorsToList had no input validation — added Zod schema
- **Fix F:** Activity logging used wrong logger — swapped to category logger
- **Fix G:** Campaign detail loaded full creator arrays — trimmed response
- **Fix H:** Email filter didn't reset pagination — added useEffect
- **Fix I:** Trial blur used page-local index — added startIndex prop
- **Fix J:** CSV export polled with no backoff — added exponential backoff

**Documentation:** `agent_docs/business-logic-fixes-2026-02-07.md`
**Tests:** 18 passing across 8 test files
**Verification:** `pnpm test` green, `pnpm typecheck` no new errors

### Previous Next Action (Resolved)
```
🚨 CRITICAL: INVESTIGATE UNCOMMITTED PRODUCTION CODE CHANGES

Context:
- Branch: staging/consolidate-all-work
- Latest commit: e75620c76 (migration snapshot and agent docs)
- Phase 1-5: ALL COMMITTED ✅
- Phase 6: Final cleanup — BUT FOUND UNCOMMITTED PRODUCTION CODE

⚠️ ALERT: Git status shows 7 uncommitted files (production code):
  M .claude/settings.json
  M app/api/keywords/suggest/route.ts
  M app/api/v2/status/route.ts
  M app/components/campaigns/keyword-search/keyword-review.jsx
  M lib/db/schema.ts
  M lib/search-engine/v2/workers/save-creators.ts
  M lib/search-engine/v2/workers/search-worker.ts

CURRENT STATUS:
✅ All Phase 1-5 work committed (landing page, analytics, scalability, CSV export, TypeScript fixes)
🚨 UNKNOWN: Why are there uncommitted changes to 7 production files?
❓ UNKNOWN: What do these changes do? Are they part of a new feature or unfinished work?
🎯 MUST INVESTIGATE before merging to main

EXACT NEXT STEPS:

1. Check what changed in each file using git diff:
   bash: git diff .claude/settings.json
   bash: git diff app/api/keywords/suggest/route.ts
   bash: git diff app/api/v2/status/route.ts
   bash: git diff app/components/campaigns/keyword-search/keyword-review.jsx
   bash: git diff lib/db/schema.ts
   bash: git diff lib/search-engine/v2/workers/save-creators.ts
   bash: git diff lib/search-engine/v2/workers/search-worker.ts

2. Analyze the changes:
   - Are these related to an ongoing feature?
   - Are these debug changes that should be reverted?
   - Are these important fixes that need to be committed?
   - Check agent_docs/current-task.md for context

3. Based on analysis, take ONE of these actions:

   OPTION A: Changes are intentional work-in-progress
   → Document what these changes do in tasks.md
   → Add them to a new checklist item in Phase 6
   → Commit with descriptive message

   OPTION B: Changes are debug/test code
   → Revert them: git checkout -- <files>
   → Verify clean state: git status

   OPTION C: Changes are incomplete feature
   → Stash them: git stash save "WIP: [description]"
   → Document in tasks.md that work was stashed
   → Proceed with Phase 6 cleanup

4. After resolving production code files, then handle agent_docs:
   bash: git add agent_docs/monologue.md agent_docs/tasks.md
   bash: git commit -m "chore: update agent docs before merge"
   bash: git push origin staging/consolidate-all-work

5. Final verification before main merge:
   - Run type check: npm run type-check
   - Run linter: npx biome check --write <modified-files>
   - Review all changes: git log main..staging/consolidate-all-work --oneline
   - Test critical paths in dev environment

START HERE: Run git diff on all 7 modified files to understand what changed.
```

## Paused Tasks

### TASK-010: Fix Search Progress UX — Keyword Search Reliability
**Status:** PAUSED (investigation phase complete, implementation pending)
**Branch:** `fix/search-progress-ux`
**Context:** Keyword search works in local dev but breaks in production (usegems.io) and UAT (sorz.ai). Backend finds 1000 creators but frontend shows partial results, stuck spinners. Requires full browser refresh to see correct results. Investigation documented root causes (Vercel serverless timing, network latency, Redis cache issues). Ready for implementation when resumed.

### TASK-006: Tech Debt Cleanup — Monolith Breakup & Code Quality
**Status:** PAUSED (for TASK-008 hotfix)
**Branch:** `UAT`
**Waiting on:** Phase 4 (Legacy Cleanup) after current hotfix
