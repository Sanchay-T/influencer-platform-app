**Task:** Cleanup legacy onboarding files + Fix Instagram creator display bug
**Branch:** `feat/local-changes-backup`
**Status:** Done

**What you did:**
- Studied onboarding flow: discovered it's a modal overlay on `/dashboard`, not separate pages
- Deleted legacy standalone onboarding pages:
  - `app/onboarding/step-1/page.tsx` (470 lines)
  - `app/onboarding/step-2/page.tsx` (439 lines)
  - `app/onboarding/complete/page.tsx` (219 lines)
  - `app/components/onboarding/stripe-payment-form.tsx` (unused)
- Fixed stale redirects in sign-up page, lists page, and email templates
- Updated `agent_docs/onboarding-flow.md` to reflect modal architecture
- **Fixed Instagram creator display bug:**
  - Campaign page showed "No creators found" despite 284 creators in DB
  - Root cause: View filter checked `video.stats.playCount` but data was at `video.statistics.views`
  - Fixed in `app/components/campaigns/keyword-search/search-results.jsx` (line 1233)

**Decisions made:**
- Keep only `app/onboarding/success/` (needed for Stripe checkout redirect)
- All onboarding redirects now point to `/dashboard` (modal opens automatically)

**What's next:**
- User verifies creators display after browser refresh
- Consider auditing similar search components for same path issue

**Task:** CLAUDE.md and Agent Documentation Setup
**Branch:** `feed/small-fixes`
**Status:** In progress

**What you did:**
- Created root `CLAUDE.md` (~260 lines) with:
  - Project overview and tech stack
  - Full user journey (onboarding → campaigns → lists → billing)
  - Commands, folder structure, tool usage
  - Critical rules (practices, linting, testing, code quality, git, session continuity)
- Created `agent_docs/` structure:
  - `code-patterns.md` — Biome rules, TypeScript patterns
  - `database.md` — Drizzle ORM workflow, schema changes
  - `testing-verification.md` — Test auth system, verification checklist
  - `current-task.md` — Active task state (updated every commit)
  - `session-history/YYYY-MM.md` — Long-term session logs

**Decisions made:**
- All docs in "you" tone (speaking to the agent)
- CLAUDE.md under 300 lines; details in agent_docs/
- Git: push freely to feature branches, merge to main only after user approval
- Context management tied to Git commits (autonomous)
- Session history: monthly files, newest entries at top

**What's next:**
- User reviews setup
- Create remaining placeholder docs if needed
