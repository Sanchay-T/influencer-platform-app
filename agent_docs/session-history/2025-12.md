**Task:** CLAUDE.md and Agent Documentation Setup
**Branch:** `feed/small-fixes`
**Status:** In progress

**What you did:**
- Created root `CLAUDE.md` (~260 lines) with:
  - Project overview and tech stack
  - Full user journey (onboarding → campaigns → lists → billing)
  - Commands, folder structure, tool usage
  - Critical rules (practices, linting, testing, code quality, git, session continuity)
- Created `agent_docs/` structure:
  - `code-patterns.md` — Biome rules, TypeScript patterns
  - `database.md` — Drizzle ORM workflow, schema changes
  - `testing-verification.md` — Test auth system, verification checklist
  - `current-task.md` — Active task state (updated every commit)
  - `session-history/YYYY-MM.md` — Long-term session logs

**Decisions made:**
- All docs in "you" tone (speaking to the agent)
- CLAUDE.md under 300 lines; details in agent_docs/
- Git: push freely to feature branches, merge to main only after user approval
- Context management tied to Git commits (autonomous)
- Session history: monthly files, newest entries at top

**What's next:**
- User reviews setup
- Create remaining placeholder docs if needed
